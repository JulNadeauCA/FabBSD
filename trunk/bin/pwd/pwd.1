.Sh NAME
.Nm pwd
.Nd return working directory name
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm pwd
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility prints the absolute pathname of the current working directory to
the standard output.
Both the Bourne shell
.Pq Xr sh 1
and Korn shell
.Pq Xr ksh 1
have their own built-in version of
.Nm pwd .
For an explanation of the directory hierarchy,
see
.Xr hier 7 .
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr ksh 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr getcwd 3 ,
.Xr hier 7
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2004
specification.
.Sh BUGS
In
.Xr csh 1 ,
the command
.Ic dirs
is always faster (although it can give a different answer in the rare case
that the current directory or a containing directory was moved after
the shell descended into it).
