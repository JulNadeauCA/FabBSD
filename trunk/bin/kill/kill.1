.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm kill
.Nd terminate or signal a process
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm kill
.Op Fl s Ar signal_name
.Ar pid ...
.Nm kill
.Fl l
.Op Ar exit_status
.Nm kill
.Fl Ar signal_name
.Ar pid ...
.Nm kill
.Fl Ar signal_number
.Ar pid ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility sends a signal to the process(es) specified
by the
.Ar pid
operand(s).
If no signal is specified,
.Dv SIGTERM
is used.
.Pp
Only the superuser may send signals to other users' processes.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl l Op Ar exit_status
Display the name of the signal corresponding to
.Ar exit_status .
.Ar exit_status
may be the exit status of a command killed by a signal
(see the
special
.Xr sh 1
parameter
.Sq ?\& )
or a signal number.
.Pp
If no operand is given, display the names of all the signals.
.It Fl s Ar signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl Ar signal_name
A symbolic signal name specifying the signal to be sent instead of the
default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.It Fl Ar signal_number
A non-negative decimal integer specifying the signal to be sent instead
of the default
.Dv SIGTERM .
.El
.Pp
The following PIDs have special meanings:
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent
.It \-1
If superuser, broadcast the signal to all processes; otherwise, broadcast
to all processes belonging to the user.
.It \- Ns Ar pgid
Send the signal to all processes within the specified process group.
.El
.Pp
Some of the more commonly used signals:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It 1
HUP (hang up)
.It 2
INT (interrupt)
.It 3
QUIT (quit)
.It 6
ABRT (abort)
.It 9
KILL (non-catchable, non-ignorable kill)
.It 14
ALRM (alarm clock)
.It 15
TERM (software termination signal)
.El
.Pp
For a more complete list, consult the
.Xr sigaction 2
manual page.
.Pp
A signal number of 0
.Pq Li kill \-0 pid
checks the validity of a certain PID, to see if it exists.
An exit code of 0 means that the specified process exists.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exists as a built-in to most shells;
they allow job specifiers of the form
.Dq %...
as arguments,
so process IDs are not as often used as
.Nm
arguments.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Forcibly terminate process ID 1234:
.Pp
.Dl $ kill -9 1234
.Pp
Send the
.Xr inetd 8
daemon the hangup signal, instructing it to re-read its configuration from
.Pa /etc/inetd.conf :
.Pp
.Dl # kill -HUP `cat /var/run/inetd.pid`
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr csh 1 ,
.Xr pkill 1 ,
.Xr ps 1 ,
.Xr sh 1 ,
.Xr kill 2 ,
.Xr sigaction 2
.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2004
specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v3 .
