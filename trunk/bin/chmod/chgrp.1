.Op Fl fh
.Oo
.Fl R
.Op Fl H | L | P
.Oc
.Ar group
.Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
sets the group ID of the specified files.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
The force option ignores errors, except for usage errors.
.It Fl H
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, symbolic links on the command line are followed.
(Symbolic links encountered in the tree traversal are not followed.)
.It Fl h
Change the group ID of the specified symbolic link.
The
.Fl h
and
.Fl R
options are mutually exclusive.
.It Fl L
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, all symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl P
If the
.Fl R
option is specified, no symbolic links are followed.
.It Fl R
Change the group ID for the file hierarchies rooted
in the files instead of just the files themselves.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fl H ,
.Fl L ,
and
.Fl P
options are ignored unless the
.Fl R
option is specified.
In addition, these options override each other and the
command's actions are determined by the last one specified.
.Pp
The
.Ar group
operand can be either a group name from the group database,
or a numeric group ID.
If a group name is also a numeric group ID, the operand is used as a
group name.
.Pp
The user invoking
.Nm
must belong to the specified group and be the owner of the file,
or be the superuser.
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or >0 if an error occurred.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/group -compact
