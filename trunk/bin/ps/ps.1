.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility displays information about active processes.
When given no options,
.Nm
prints information about processes of the current user that have a
controlling terminal.
.Pp
The information displayed is selected based on a set of keywords (and for
even more control, see the
.Fl L ,
.Fl O ,
and
.Fl o
options).
The default output format includes, for each process, the process's ID,
controlling terminal, CPU time (including both user and system time),
state, and associated command.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Display information about other users' processes as well as your own.
.It Fl C
Change the way the CPU percentage is calculated by using a
.Dq raw
CPU calculation that ignores
.Dq resident
time (this normally has
no effect).
.It Fl c
Do not display full command with arguments, but only the
executable name.
This may be somewhat confusing; for example, all
.Xr sh 1
scripts will show as
.Dq sh .
.It Fl e
Display the environment as well.
.It Fl h
Repeat the information header as often as necessary to guarantee one
header per page of information.
.It Fl j
Print information associated with the following keywords:
user, pid, ppid, pgid, sess, jobc, state, tt, time, and command.
.It Fl k
Also display information about kernel threads.
.It Fl L
List the set of available keywords.
This option should not be specified with other options.
.It Fl l
Display information associated with the following keywords:
uid, pid, ppid, cpu, pri, nice, vsz, rss, wchan, state, tt, time,
and command.
.It Fl M Ar core
Extract values associated with the name list from the specified core
instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl m
Sort by memory usage, instead of by start time ID.
.It Fl N Ar system
Extract the name list from the specified system instead of the running kernel.
.It Fl O Ar fmt
Add the information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specified, after the process ID,
in the default information
display.
Keywords may be appended with an equals sign
.Pq Sq =
and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.It Fl o Ar fmt
Display information associated with the space or comma separated list
of keywords specified.
Keywords may be appended with an equals sign
.Pq Sq =
and a string.
This causes the printed header to use the specified string instead of
the standard header.
.It Fl p Ar pid
Display information associated with the specified process ID.
.It Fl r
Sort by current CPU usage, instead of by start time ID.
.It Fl S
Change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited
children to their parent process.
.It Fl T
Display information about processes attached to the device associated
with the standard input.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Display information about processes attached to the specified terminal
device.
.It Fl U Ar username
Display the processes belonging to the specified
.Ar username .
.It Fl u
Display information associated with the following keywords:
user, pid, %cpu, %mem, vsz, rss, tt, state, start, time, and command.
The
.Fl u
option implies the
.Fl r
option.
.It Fl v
Display information associated with the following keywords:
pid, state, time, sl, re, pagein, vsz, rss, lim, tsiz,
%cpu, %mem, and command.
The
.Fl v
option implies the
.Fl m
option.
.It Fl W Ar swap
Extract swap information from the specified file instead of the
default
.Dq /dev/drum .
.It Fl w
Use 132 columns to display information, instead of the default, which
is the window size.
If the
.Fl w
option is specified more than once,
.Nm
will use as many columns as necessary without regard for window size.
.It Fl x
Display information about processes without controlling terminals.

.Sh KEYWORDS
The following is a complete list of the available keywords
and their meanings.
Several of them have aliases,
which are also noted.

be very young) it is possible for the sum of all

The percentage of real memory used by this process.
.It Cm acflag
Alias:
.Cm acflg .
Accounting flag.
.It Cm command

.Sh STANDARDS
The
.Nm
utility is compliant with the
.St -p1003.1-2004
specification.
.Pp
The flags
.Op Fl CchjkLMmNOrST
are extensions to that specification.
.Sh HISTORY
A
.Nm
command appeared in
.At v3
in section 8 of the manual.
.Sh CAVEATS
When printing using the
.Cm command
keyword, a process that has exited and
has a parent that has not yet waited for the process (in other words, a zombie)
is listed as
.Dq Aq defunct ,
and a process which is blocked while trying
to exit is listed as
.Dq Aq exiting .
.Nm
makes an educated guess as to the file name and arguments given when the
process was created by examining memory or the swap area.
The method is inherently somewhat unreliable and in any event a process
is entitled to destroy this information, so the names cannot be depended
on too much.
The
.Cm ucomm
(accounting) keyword can, however, be depended on.
.Sh BUGS
Since
.Nm
cannot run faster than the system and is run as any other scheduled
process, the information it displays can never be exact.
