.Sh NAME
.Nm tcpdchk
.Nd tcp wrapper configuration checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm tcpdchk
.Op Fl adv
.Op Fl i Ar inet_conf
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
examines your tcp wrapper configuration and reports all
potential and real problems it can find.
The program examines the
.Xr tcpd 8
access control files (by default, these are
.Pa /etc/hosts.allow
and
.Pa /etc/hosts.deny ) ,
and compares the
entries in these files against entries in the
.Xr inetd 8
network configuration file.
.Pp
.Nm
reports problems such as non-existent pathnames; services
that appear in
.Xr tcpd 8
access control rules, but are not controlled by
.Xr tcpd 8 ;
services that should not be wrapped; non-existent host
names or non-internet address forms; occurrences of host aliases
instead of official host names; hosts with a name/address conflict;
inappropriate use of wildcard patterns; inappropriate use of NIS
netgroups or references to non-existent NIS netgroups; references to
non-existent options; invalid arguments to options; and so on.
.Pp
Where possible,
.Nm
provides a helpful suggestion to fix the problem.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Report access control rules that permit access without an explicit
ALLOW keyword.
.\" This applies only when the extended access control
.\" language is enabled (build with -DPROCESS_OPTIONS).
.It Fl d
Examine
.Pa hosts.allow
and
.Pa hosts.deny
files in the current directory instead of the default ones.
.It Fl i Ar inet_conf
Specify this option when
.Nm
is unable to find your
.Pa inetd.conf
network configuration file, or when you wish to test with a non-default one.
.It Fl v
Display the contents of each access control rule.
Daemon lists, client lists, shell commands and options are shown in a
pretty-printed format; this makes it easier for you to spot any
discrepancies between what you want and what the program understands.
