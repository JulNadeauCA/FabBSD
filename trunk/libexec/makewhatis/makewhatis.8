.Sh NAME
.Nm makewhatis
.Nd create a whatis.db database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm makewhatis
.Op Fl p
.Op Ar manpath ...
.Nm makewhatis
.Op Fl p
.Fl d Ar manpath
.Ar files ...
.Nm makewhatis
.Op Fl p
.Fl u Ar manpath
.Ar files ...
.Nm makewhatis
.Op Fl p
.Fl t
.Ar files
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
strips the NAME lines from compiled or raw
.Xr man 1
pages and creates
a whatis.db database (that is, a subject index)
for use with
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.Xr whatis 1 ,
and
.Xr man 1 's
.Fl k
option.
If
.Ar manpath
is unspecified,
.Nm
by default creates databases for each directory prefixed by
the _whatdb keyword in
.Pa /etc/man.conf .
Man pages compressed with
.Xr compress 1
and
.Xr gzip 1
are uncompressed before processing.
.Pp
If the
.Fl d
option is used,
.Nm
merges the description of
.Ar files
with an existing
.Pa whatis.db
database in
.Ar manpath .
.Pp
If the
.Fl u
option is used,
.Nm
removes the description of
.Ar files
from an existing
.Pa whatis.db
database in
.Ar manpath .
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used,
.Nm
is less forgiving and warns about incorrect man pages.
.Pp
The
.Fl t
option can be used to check a set of potential man pages without
changing any
.Pa whatis.db
database.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /etc/man.conf -compact
.It Pa whatis.db
index to man pages in directory
.It Pa /etc/man.conf
man configuration information
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr apropos 1 ,
.Xr man 1 ,
.Xr nroff 1 ,
.Xr whatis 1 ,
.Xr man.conf 5
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
should parse
.Pa /etc/man.conf
and deal with extra configuration information.
In particular, it does not handle
.Xr nroff 1
.Cm me
format.
Likewise, its use of
heuristics to retrieve subjects from most man pages is not 100% accurate.
