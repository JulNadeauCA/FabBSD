.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn pthread_suspend_np
function interrupts the given thread and places it in a suspended state.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_suspend_all_np
function interrupts all threads except the current thread and places them in a suspended state.
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_resume_np
function resumes a thread suspended with
.Fn pthread_suspend_np
or
.Fn pthread_suspend_all_np .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_resume_all_np
function resumes all threads suspended with
.Fn pthread_suspend_np
or
.Fn pthread_suspend_all_np .
.Pp
The
.Fn pthread_resume_np
and
.Fn pthread_resume_all_np
functions have no effect on threads that have not been suspended.
.Pp
Suspending and resuming a thread has an effect similar to that of
receiving a signal,
namely that resumed system calls will return an error value of
.Er EINTR .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
The
.Fn pthread_suspend_np
and
.Fn pthread_resume_np
functions fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ESRCH
No thread could be found corresponding to that specified by the given
thread ID.

.Fn pthread_resume_np
and
.Fn pthread_resume_all_np
functions are non-portable and may not be supported with the above
