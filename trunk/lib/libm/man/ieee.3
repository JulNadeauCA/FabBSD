.Sh DESCRIPTION
These functions are required or recommended by
.St -ieee754 .
.Pp
.Fn copysign
returns
.Fa x
with its sign changed to
.Fa y Ns 's.
The
.Fn copysignf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn copysign .
.Pp
.Fn ilogb
returns
.Fa x Ns 's exponent
.Fa n ,
in integer format.
.Fn ilogb \*(Pm\*(If
returns
.Dv INT_MAX
and
.Fn ilogb 0
returns
.Dv INT_MIN .
The
.Fn ilogbf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn ilogb .
.Pp
.Fn nextafter
returns the next machine representable number from
.Fa x
in direction
.Fa y .
The
.Fn nextafterf
function is a single precision version of
.Fn nextafter .
.Pp
.Fn scalbn
returns
.Fa x Ns \(**(2** Ns Fa n )
computed by exponent manipulation.
