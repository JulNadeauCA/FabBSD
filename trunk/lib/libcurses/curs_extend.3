.SH NAME
\fBcurs_extend\fR,
\fBcurses_version\fP,
\fBuse_extended_names\fP \- miscellaneous curses extensions
..
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <curses.h>\fP

\fBconst char * curses_version(void);\fP
.br
\fBint use_extended_names(bool enable);\fP
..
.SH DESCRIPTION
These functions are extensions to the curses library
which do not fit easily into other categories.
.PP
Use
.I curses_version()
to get the version number, including patch level of the library, e.g.,
.B 5.0.19991023
.PP
The
.I use_extended_names()
function controls whether the calling application
is able to use user-defined or nonstandard names
which may be compiled into the terminfo
description, i.e., via the terminfo or termcap interfaces.
Normally these names are available for use, since the essential decision
is made by using the \fB-x\fP option of \fItic\fP to compile
extended terminal definitions.
However you can disable this feature
to ensure compatibility with other implementations of curses.
..
.SH PORTABILITY
These routines are specific to ncurses.  They were not supported on
Version 7, BSD or System V implementations.  It is recommended that
any code depending on them be conditioned using NCURSES_VERSION.
