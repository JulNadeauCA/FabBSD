.Sh NAME
.Nm auth_destroy ,
.Nm authnone_create ,
.Nm authunix_create ,
.Nm authunix_create_default
.Nd library routines for remote procedure calls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <rpc/rpc.h>
.Ft void
.Fn auth_destroy "AUTH *auth"
.Ft AUTH *
.Fn authnone_create "void"
.Ft AUTH *
.Fn authunix_create "char *host" "int uid" "int gid" "int len" "int *aup.gids"
.Ft AUTH *
.Fn authunix_create_default "void"
.Ft void
.Fn set_rpc_maxgrouplist "int num"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These routines establish authentication information for use by the
RPC functions described in
.Xr rpc 3 .
.Pp
.Fn auth_destroy
is a macro that destroys the authentication information associated with
.Fa auth .
Destruction usually involves deallocation of private data structures.
The use of
.Fa auth
is undefined after calling
.Fn auth_destroy .
.Pp
.Fn authnone_create
creates and returns an
.Tn RPC
authentication handle that passes nonusable authentication
information with each remote procedure call.
This is the default authentication used by
.Tn RPC .
.Pp
.Fn authunix_create
creates and returns an
.Tn RPC
authentication handle that contains
.Ux
authentication information.
The parameter
.Fa host
is the name of the machine on which the information was
created;
.Fa uid
is the user's user ID;
.Fa gid
is the user's current group ID;
.Fa len
and
.Fa aup_gids
refer to a counted array of groups to which the user belongs.
It is easy to impersonate a user.
.Pp
.Fn authunix_create_default
calls
.Fn authunix_create
with the appropriate parameters.
.Pp
.Fn set_rpc_maxgrouplist
allows the application to set the maximum size of the group list that
will be used in
.Fn authunix_create_default
to
.Fa num .
Some servers will refuse mounts if the group list is larger than it
expects (like 8).
