.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm getrpcport
.Nd get RPC port number
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <rpc/rpc.h>
.Ft int
.Fn getrpcport "char *host" "int prognum" "int versnum" "int proto"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getrpcport
returns the port number for version
.Fa versnum
of the RPC program
.Fa prognum
running on
.Fa host
and using protocol
.Fa proto .
It returns 0 if it cannot contact the portmapper, or if
.Fa prognum
is not registered.
If
.Fa prognum
is registered but not with version
.Fa versnum ,
it will still return a port number (for some version of the program)
indicating that the program is indeed registered.
The version mismatch will be detected upon the first call to the service.
