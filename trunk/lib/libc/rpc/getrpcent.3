.Fn getrpcent void
.Ft struct rpcent *

.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Fn getrpcent ,
.Fn getrpcbyname ,
and
.Fn getrpcbynumber ,
each return a pointer to an object with the
following structure
containing the broken-out
fields of a line in the rpc program number database,
.Pa /etc/rpc :
.Bd -literal -offset 2n
struct rpcent {
	char	*r_name;	/* name of server for this rpc program */
	char	**r_aliases;	/* alias list */
	int	r_number;	/* rpc program number */
};
.Ed
.Pp
The members of this structure are:
.Bl -tag -width r_aliases -offset indent
.It r_name
The name of the server for this rpc program.
.It r_aliases
A zero terminated list of alternate names for the rpc program.
.It r_number
The rpc program number for this service.
.El
.Pp
.Fn getrpcent
reads the next line of the file, opening the file if necessary.
.Pp
.Fn setrpcent
opens and rewinds the file.
If the
.Fa stayopen
flag is non-zero,
the net database will not be closed after each call to
.Fn getrpcent
(either directly, or indirectly through one of
the other
.Dq getrpc
calls).
.Pp
.Fn endrpcent
closes the file.
.Pp
.Fn getrpcbyname
and
.Fn getrpcbynumber
sequentially search from the beginning
of the file until a matching rpc program name or
program number is found, or until end-of-file is encountered.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /etc/rpc
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A
.Dv NULL
pointer is returned on
.Dv EOF
or error.
