.Sh NAME
.Nm cncjog
.Nd enter manual control mode for a motorized axis
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/cnc.h>
.Ft int
.Fn cncjog "const struct cnc_velocity *vel"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A call to
.Nm
invokes the kernel's trajectory planner in "jog" mode.
This allows the operator manual control over one or more axes (e.g.,
registered
.Xr servo 4
devices).
.Pp
The
.Fa vel
argument specifies the optimal velocity profile.
.Pp
The
.Nm
call returns only after a software stop has been raised by a device such as
.Xr estop 4 .
.Pp
The
.Fa vel
argument specifies the velocity profile.
.Ft cnc_velocity
is defined as:
.Bd -literal
struct cnc_velocity {
	u_long v0;		 /* min steps/s */
	u_long F;		 /* max steps/s */
	u_long Amax;		 /* max steps/ms^2 */
	u_long Jmax;		 /* max steps/ms^3 */
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Va v0
field specifies the initial velocity in steps/second.
It can be set to zero.
Too high a value can cause shock in the machine.
.Va i_F
specifies the nominal velocity in steps/second.
The kernel may or may not reach this value depending on the length of motion
and kinematic limits.
.Va i_Amax
is the limit on acceleration in steps/second^2 and
.Va i_Jmax
specifies the jerk limit in steps/second^3.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
If the motion is successful, a 0 value is returned.
A return value of \-1 indicates an error, which is further specified in the global
.Va errno .
.Sh ERRORS
The
.Fn cncmove
will fail if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ENXIO
The trajectory planner has not been calibrated (i.e., the
.Dv CNC_CALTIMINGS
or
.Dv CNC_SETTIMINGS
ioctls have not been invoked).
.It Bq Er EINVAL
One of the specified parameters exceeds the kinematic limits of the machine
(as set by the
.Dv CNC_SETKINLIMITS
ioctl).
