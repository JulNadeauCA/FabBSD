If your UltraSPARC machine is somewhat old, it might need a firmware update
before it can be used under FabBSD. You are advised to try to install
FabBSD first; if it can't boot or fails mysteriously, you might need to
update your firmware. To do so, check the ``Updating your firmware''
section later in this document.

Your OpenBOOT ROM may need some setup.  You cannot use the security modes
of the OpenBOOT ROM.  Make sure that the ROM security modes are disabled:

    ok setenv security-mode none


Please note that while FabBSD and Solaris have a reasonable degree of
compatibility between disk labels and filesystems there are some problems
to watch out for during initial installation or when trying to maintain
both FabBSD and Solaris environments on the same system.

    If the FabBSD fsck(8) utility is used on a Solaris filesystem, it will
    set FabBSD "clean flags" and BSD4.4 summary fields in the superblock.
    Solaris does *not* like this and you will have to do a "fsck -b 32" under
    Solaris to access an alternate superblock to repair the filesystem.  You
    should always specify Solaris filesystems with a "pass number" of 0 in
    their /etc/fstab entry to prevent this, and preferably mount them "RO".

    If Solaris fsck is used on an FabBSD filesystem in the default FabBSD
    (4.4BSD) format, it will first complain about the superblock and then
    about missing . and .. entries.  Do *not* try to "correct" these
    problems, as attempting to do so will completely trash the filesystem.

    You should avoid using soft updates (option softdep in /etc/fstab)
    on your shared filesystems.  Although untested, it is likely that
    Solaris would be confused by a filesystem with soft update flags
    enabled.

The FabBSD "Sun Compatible" disklabel has been extended to support 16
partitions, which may be compatible with Solaris, but Solaris only sees
the first 8 partitions and may "lose" information about the extended
partitions.



FabBSD and Sun bootblocks are similar in concept, though implemented
differently.  The FabBSD bootblocks are architecture independent and also
understand the extended disk labels with 16 partitions.  You can use Solaris
bootblocks, but remember that FabBSD bootblocks must be installed with
FabBSD installboot and Solaris bootblocks with Solaris installboot.

Most of the new Ultras shipped by Sun with a preinstalled Solaris have an
initial specific factory setup of the boot ROM, in order to start up
Solaris WebStart at the first boot; the boot-device variable is set to
disk:f.  Make sure you reset the boot device to its default value:

    ok set-default boot-device

will work for most systems. This can be adapted if you've multiple
systems installed and know what you're doing.

To disable automatic boot use the following command:

    ok setenv auto-boot? false

and then to enable it later use:

    ok setenv auto-boot? true

or on an installed system use the eeprom(8) command:

    # eeprom 'auto-boot?=true'

Updating your firmware:
-----------------------

If FabBSD does not boot or install properly on your machine, it might need
a firmware update.

Updating your firmware is a dangerous operation which may damage your
hardware. Be sure to carefully follow these instructions and, if in doubt,
please don't do this.

You will need to have a working operating system installed on your machine,
in order to perform the update.  If this is not the case, you might be able
to boot the flash updater software via network, but this has not been tested
and is not supported by Sun.

The firmware update is delivered as a specific patch, depending on your
machine:

You can use SunSolve to get the patches by entering the
correct Patch-ID# to the corresponding field at
    http://sunsolve.sun.com/pub-cgi/show.pl?target=patchpage

Follow the patch installation notes very carefully. You will need to open
your machine in order to apply this patch.
