dnl FabBSDInstallPrelude(troublesome disk types)
dnl
dnl Installation introduction. Warns about disk geometry hell if argument
dnl is not empty.
define({:-FabBSDInstallPrelude-:},
{:-Installing FabBSD is a relatively complex process, but if you have
this document in hand and are careful to read and remember the
information which is presented to you by the install program, it
shouldn't be too much trouble.ifelse(X$1,X,,{:-

If the disks connected to your machine are $1,
it is recommended that you know their geometry, i.e. the sector size (note
that sector sizes other than 512 bytes are not currently supported), the
number of sectors per track, the number of tracks per cylinder (also known
as the number of heads), and the number of cylinders on the disk.  The
FabBSD kernel will try to discover these parameters on its own, and if it
can it will print them at boot time.  If possible, you should use the
parameters it prints.  (You might not be able to because you're sharing your
disk with another operating system, or because your disk is old enough that
the kernel can't figure out its geometry.)-:})-:})dnl
dnl
dnl FabBSDInstallPart2
dnl Describes the beginning of the installation process, once the
dnl installation media is ready.
define({:-FabBSDInstallPart2-:},
{:-You should now be ready to install FabBSD.

The following is a walk-through of the steps you will take while
getting FabBSD installed on your hard disk.  If any question has a
default answer, it will be displayed in brackets ("[]") after the
question.  If you wish to stop the installation, you may hit Control-C
at any time, but if you do, you'll have to begin the installation
process again from scratch.  Using Control-Z to suspend the process
may be a better option, or at any prompt enter '!' to get a shell,
from which 'exit' will return you back to that prompt (no refresh
of the prompt though).-:})dnl

dnl Describes the boot of the ramdisk, the expected disk devices
dnl names, and warns bore the reader with geometry concerns if the
dnl first argument is not empty.
define({:-FabBSDBootMsgs-:},
{:-	Once the kernel has loaded, you will be presented with the

	As mentioned above, you will need your disks geometry (which
	will be printed on a line beginning with its name) when
	creating FabBSD partitions.-:})
	You will also need to know the device name to tell the
	install tools what disk to install on.  If you cannot read
	the messages as they scroll by, do not worry -- you can get
	at this information later inside the install program.-:})dnl
dnl
dnl FabBSDInstallPart3
dnl
dnl Describes the beginning of the bsd.rd operation.
dnl
define({:-FabBSDInstallPart3-:},
{:-	After entering the terminal type you will be asked whether you
	wish to do an "(I)nstall" or an "(U)pgrade".  Enter 'I' for a
	fresh install or 'U' to upgrade an existing installation.

	You will be presented with a welcome message and asked if
	you really wish to install (or upgrade).  Assuming you
	answered yes, the install program will then tell you which
	disks of that type it can install on, and ask you which it
	should use.  Reply with the name of your disk.-:})dnl
dnl
dnl FabBSDInstallPart4(mention about other OS partitions)
dnl Describes the disklabel operation
dnl
define({:-FabBSDInstallPart4-:},
{:-	Next the disk label which defines the layout of the FabBSD
	file systems must be set up.  The installation script will
	invoke an interactive editor allowing you to do this.  Note
	that partition 'c' inside this disk label should ALWAYS
	reflect the entire disk, including any non-FabBSD portions.
	If you are labeling a new disk, you will probably start
	out with an 'a' partition that spans the disk.  In this
	case you should delete 'a' before adding new partitions.
	The root file system should be in partition 'a', and swap
	is usually in partition 'b'.$1

	It is recommended that you create separate partitions for /usr,
	/tmp, and /var, and if you have room for it, one for /home.  In
	doing this, remember to skip 'c', leaving it as type "unused".
	For help in the disk label editor, enter '?' or 'M' to view the
	manual page (see the info on the ``-E'' flag).-:})dnl
dnl
dnl FabBSDInstallPart5
dnl More disklabel notes(disk)
define({:-FabBSDInstallPart5-:},
{:-	The swap partition (usually 'b') should have a type of "swap", all
	other native FabBSD partitions should have a type of "4.2BSD".

	The install program will now label your disk and ask which file
	systems should be created on which partitions.  It will auto-
	matically select the 'a' partition to be the root file system.
	Next it will ask for which disk and partition you want a file
	system created on.  This will be the same as the disk name (e.g.
	"$1") with the letter identifying the partition (e.g. "d")
	appended (e.g. "$1d").  Then it will ask where this partition is
	to be mounted, e.g. /usr.  This process will be repeated until
	you enter "done".

	At this point you will be asked to confirm that the file system
	information you have entered is correct, and given an opportunity
	to change the file system table.  Next it will create the new file
	systems as specified, OVERWRITING ANY EXISTING DATA.  This is the
	point of no return.-:})dnl
dnl
dnl FabBSDInstallNet(other installation sources,hasfloppy)
dnl Setting up the network
define({:-FabBSDInstallNet-:},
{:-	After all your file systems have been created, the install program
	will prompt you for the system hostname, and will give you an
	opportunity to configure the network.  The network configuration
	you enter (if any) can then be used to do the install from another
	system using HTTP or FTP, and will also be the configuration used
	by the system after the installation is complete.

	Note that the system hostname should be without the domain part.

If you select to configure the network, the install program will
ask you for the name of your system and the DNS domain name to use.
Note that the host name should be without the domain part, and that
the domain name should NOT {:-include-:} the host name part.

	If you select to configure the network, the install program will
	give you a list of network interfaces you can configure.  For each
	network interface you select to configure, it will ask for the IP
	address to use, the symbolic host name to use, the netmask to use,
	and any interface-specific flags to set.  If the IP address should
	be obtained from a DHCP server, simply enter ``dhcp'' when asked
	for the IP address.  The interface-specific flags are usually used
	to determine which media the network card is to use.  Typically no
	media flags are required as autodetection normally works, but you
	will be prompted with a list of the acceptable media flags, and
	asked if you want to provide any.  In doubt, do not enter any media
	flags; or you can refer to the manual page for your interface for
	the appropriate flags.

	After all network interfaces have been configured, the install pro-
	gram will ask for the DNS domain name to use, as well as the IP
	address of the primary name server to use.  Finally, you will be
	asked for the IP address of the default route.

	You will also be presented with an opportunity to edit the host
	table.

	At this point you will be asked for the initial root password of
	the system, twice.  Although the install program will only check
	that the two passwords match, you should make sure to use a
	strong password.  As a minimum, the password should be at least
	six characters long and a mixture of both lower and uppercase
	letters, numbers and punctuation characters.

        After these preparatory steps have been completed, you will be
        able to extract the distribution sets onto your system.  There
        are several install methods supported; FTP, HTTP, tape,
	$1or a local disk partition.

define({:-FabBSDFTPInstall-:},
{:-	To install via FTP:
		To begin an FTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information.  Don't be daunted by this list;
		the defaults are sufficient for most people.
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       FTP proxy (squid, CERN FTP, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to {:-define-:} a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing FTP (assuming you
		       have a proxy available to use).
		    2) Do you need to use active mode FTP?  By default,
		       ftp will attempt to use passive mode and fall
		       back to an active connection if the server does
		       not support passive mode.  You only need to enable
		       this option if you are connecting to a buggy FTP
		       daemon that implements passive FTP incorrectly.
		       Note that you will not be asked about active
		       FTP if you are using a proxy.
		    3) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an FTP server
		       carrying the FabBSD OSREV distribution.
		       If you don't know, answer ``y'' when asked if
		       you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    4) The FTP directory holding the distribution sets.
		       The default value of pub/FabBSD/OSREV/MACHINE
		       is almost always correct.
		    5) The login and password for the FTP account.
		       You will only be asked for a password for
		       non-anonymous FTP.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		FTP, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.-:})dnl
dnl
define({:-FabBSDHTTPInstall-:},
{:-	To install via HTTP:
		To begin an HTTP install you will need the following
		pieces of information:
		    1) Proxy server URL if you are using a URL-based
		       HTTP proxy (squid, CERN FTP, Apache 1.2 or higher).
		       You need to {:-define-:} a proxy if you are behind a
		       firewall that blocks outgoing HTTP connections
		       (assuming you have a proxy available to use).
		    2) The IP address (or hostname if you enabled
		       DNS earlier in the install) of an HTTP server
		       carrying the FabBSD OSREV distribution.
		       If you don't know, answer ``y'' when asked if
		       you want to see a list of such hosts.
		    3) The directory holding the distribution sets.
		       There is no standard location for this;
		       You should use the directory specified
		       along with the server in the list of official
		       HTTP mirror sites that you received in step 3.

		For instructions on how to complete the installation via
		HTTP, see the section named "Common URL installations" below.-:})dnl
dnl
dnl For arches where you can create a boot tape, $1 can be set as the
dnl file index of the first set, after the boot files.
define({:-FabBSDTAPEInstall-:},
{:-	To install from tape:
		In order to install from tape, the distribution sets to be
		installed must have been written to tape previously, either
		in tar format or gzip-compressed tar format.

		You will also have to identify the tape device where the
		distribution sets are to be extracted from.  This will
		typically be "nrst0" (no-rewind, raw interface).

		Next you will have to specify how many files have to be
		skipped on the tape.  This number is usually zero{:--:}ifelse(X$1,X,,{:-, unless
		you have created a bootable tape, in which case the number
		will be $1-:}).

		The install program will not automatically detect whether
		an image has been compressed, so it will ask for that
		information before starting the extraction.-:})dnl
dnl
define({:-FabBSDCDROMInstall-:},
{:-	To install from CD-ROM:
		When installing from a CD-ROM, you will be asked which
		device holds the distribution sets.  This will typically
		be "cd0".  Next you will be asked which partition on the
		CD-ROM the distribution is to be loaded from.  This is
		normally partition "a".

		Next you will have to identify the file system type that
		has been used to create the distribution on the CD-ROM,
		this can be either FFS or ISO CD9660.  The FabBSD CD-ROM
		distribution uses the CD9660 format.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the CD-ROM which holds the distribution, for
		the MACHINE this is "OSREV/MACHINE".

		For instructions on how to complete the installation from
		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common
		file system installations" below.-:})dnl
dnl
define({:-FabBSDNFSInstall-:},
{:-	To install from an NFS mounted directory:
		When installing from an NFS-mounted directory, you must
		have completed network configuration above, and also
		set up the exported file system on the NFS server in
		advance.

		First you must identify the IP address of the NFS server
		to load the distribution from, and the file system the
		server expects you to mount.

		The install program will also ask whether or not TCP
		should be used for transport (the default is UDP).  Note
		that TCP only works with newer NFS servers.

		You will also have to provide the relative path to the
		directory on the file system where the distribution sets
		are located.  Note that this path should not be prefixed
		with a '/'.

		the CD-ROM distribution, see the section named "Common

define({:-FabBSDUpgrade-:},
{:-Warning! Upgrades to FabBSD OSREV are currently only supported from the
immediately previous release.  The upgrade process will also work with older
releases, but might not execute some migration tasks that would be necessary
for a proper upgrade.  The best solution, whenever possible, is to backup
your data and reinstall from scratch.

To upgrade FabBSD OSREV from a previous version, start with the general
instructions in the section "Installing FabBSD".

Boot from $1.
When prompted, select the (U)pgrade option rather than the (I)nstall
option at the prompt in the install process.

The upgrade script will ask you for the existing root partition, and
will use the existing filesystems defined in /etc/fstab to install the
new system in.  It will also use your existing network parameters.

From then, the upgrade procedure is very close to the installation
procedure described earlier in this document.  Note that the upgrade
procedure will not let you pick neither the ``etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz'' nor the
``xetc{:--:}OSrev.tgz'' sets, so as to preserve your files in `/etc' which
you are likely to have customized since a previous installation.

However, it is strongly advised that you unpack the etc{:--:}OSrev.tgz and
xetc{:--:}OSrev.tgz sets in a temporary directory and merge changes by hand, or
with the help of the sysmerge(8) helper script, since all components of
your system may not function correctly until your files in `/etc' are
updated.-:})dnl

define({:-FabBSDXferFloppyFromDOS-:},
{:-Creating a bootable floppy disk using DOS/Windows:

	First you need to get access to the FabBSD bootable floppy
	images.  If you can access the distribution from the CD-ROM under
	DOS, you will find the bootable disks in the OSREV/MACHINE
	directory.  Otherwise, you will have to download them from one of
	the FabBSD FTP or HTTP mirror sites, using an FTP client or a web
	browser.  In either case, take care to do "binary" transfers, since
	these are images files and any DOS cr/lf translations or control/z
	EOF interpretations will result in corrupted transfers.
	
	You will also need to go to the "tools" directory and grab a
	copy of the rawrite.exe utility and its documentation.  This
	program is needed to correctly copy the bootable filesystem
	image to the floppy, since it's an image of a unix partition
	containing an ffs filesystem, not an MSDOS format diskette.

	Once you have installed rawrite.exe, just run it and specify the
	name of the bootable image, such as "floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs" and the name of
	the floppy drive, such as "a:".  Be sure to use good quality HD
	(1.44MB) floppies, formatted on the system you're using.  The
	image copy and boot process is not especially tolerant of read
	errors.

	Note that if you are using NT, 2000, or XP to write the
	images to disk, you will need to use ntrw.exe instead.  It
	is also available in the "tools" directory.  Grab it and
	run in with the correct arguments like this "ntrw <image>
	<drive>:"

	Note that, when installing, the boot floppy can be write-protected
	(i.e. read-only).-:})dnl
dnl
define({:-FabBSDXferFloppyFromUNIX-:},
{:-Creating a bootable floppy disk using SunOS, Solaris or other Un*x-like system:

	First, you will need obtain a local copy of the bootable filesystem
	image as described above.  If possible use the md5(1) command to
	verify the checksums of the images vs. the values in the MD5 file
	on the mirror site.

	Next, use the dd(1) utility to copy the file to the floppy drive.
	The command would likely be, under SunOS:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rfd0c bs=36b
	and, under Solaris:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/dev/rdiskette0 bs=36b
	unless the volume management daemon, vold(1M), is running, in
	which case the following command is preferable:
		dd if=floppy{:--:}OSrev.fs of=/vol/dev/rdiskette0 bs=36b

	If you are using another operating system, you may have to adapt
	this to conform to local naming conventions for the floppy and
	options suitable for copying to a "raw" floppy image.  The key
	issue is that the device name used for the floppy *must* be one
	that refers to the correct block device, not a partition or
	compatibility mode, and the copy command needs to be compatible
	with the requirement that writes to a raw device must be in
	multiples of 512-byte blocks.  The variations are endless and
	beyond the scope of this document.

	If you're doing this on the system you intend to boot the floppy on,
	copying the floppy back to a file and doing a compare or checksum
	is a good way to verify that the floppy is readable and free of
	read/write errors.

	transfer the distribution sets to your local system, using ftp or
	by mounting the CD-ROM containing the release.  Then you need to
	make a tape containing the files.
