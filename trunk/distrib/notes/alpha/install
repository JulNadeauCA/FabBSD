There are several ways to install FabBSD onto a disk.  The easiest way is
to boot from the bootable CD-ROM mini image, then install from your favorite
source. You can also use one of the FabBSD installation floppies, if your
machine has a floppy drive. Network booting is supported through means of
dhcpd(8) and tftpd(8).

Booting from Floppy Disk installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter
		boot dva0
	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  It will take a
	while to load the kernel from the floppy, most likely more
	than a minute.  If some action doesn't eventually happen,
	or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing further has
	happened, or the machine spontaneously reboots, then either
	you have a bad boot floppy (in which case you should try
	another) or your alpha is not currently supported by FabBSD.

Booting from CD-ROM installation media:

	At the SRM console prompt, enter
		show device
	to find the device ID of your CD-ROM drive (the device ID is
	usually in the second column (``bootdev'') and should start
	with DKA for a SCSI CD-ROM drive).  If your drive shows up with
	a drive number with trailing zeros, you will want to ignore them
	(unless it is DKA0).  For example, if your CD-ROM drive is listed
	as DKA600, you want to use dka6 (device IDs are case
	insensitive).

	Insert the FabBSD/MACHINE CD-ROM and enter
		boot DEVICE
	where DEVICE is the dka device name.

	You should see info about the primary and secondary boot
	and then the kernel should start to load.  If the kernel
	fails to load or the spinning cursor has stopped and nothing
	further has happened, you either have a hardware problem or
	your MACHINE is not currently supported by FabBSD; try booting
	from a floppy instead if possible.

Booting from Network:

	In order to bootstrap via the network, you must provide a second
	system to act as a boot server. It is convenient if this is a second
	FabBSD machine as the necessary services are already installed,
	although source code for such programs as dhcpd can be found in
	FabBSD's source tree, and should be reasonably portable to other
	UN*X-like operating systems. More information on diskless booting
	can be found in the FabBSD diskless(8) manual page.

	In this case, you will need to set up dhcpd on the server, which can
	serve bootp protocol requests.  Start by editing the /etc/dhcpd.conf
	on the bootserver, and declare an information block. Here is an
	example:

	subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.0.0.0 {
		host piper {
			always-reply-rfc1048 "true";
			filename "netboot";
			option root-path "/alpha";
			hardware ethernet 00:02:56:00:73:31;
			fixed-address 10.42.42.42;
		}
	}

	Do not forget to enable dhcpd.

	You will also need to enable tftpd, for the MACHINE to download the
	"netboot" from the server in the /tftpboot directory.

	Next, you need to add an entry for your MACHINE in /etc/bootparams.
	For example:

		piper		root=myserver:/alpha

	Enable rpc.bootparamd either by turning it on in /etc/rc.conf and
	rebooting, or by running it manually.

	Only uncompressed kernels are supported for booting in this release.
	This means you have to execute the following command on your boot
	server before installing a new kernel for your MACHINE to boot:

	# gzip -dc bsd.rd > /alpha/bsd

	This assumes you have path /alpha exported via NFS.

	Once loaded, netboot will mount /alpha over NFS and load the kernel
	from there.

Installing using the Floppy, CD-ROM or Network procedure:

FabBSDInstallPart2

	Boot your machine from the installation media as described above.

	It will take a while to load the miniroot image, especially from
	a slow network connection or a CD-ROM, most likely more than a minute.
	If some action doesn't eventually happen, or the spinning cursor
	has stopped and nothing further has happened, either your boot
	media is bad, your diskless setup is incorrect, or you may have
	a hardware or configuration problem.

	You will next be asked for your terminal type.  If you are
	installing from a non-serial console, the default of "vt220"
	is correct.  If you are installing from a serial console
	you should choose the terminal type from amongst those listed.
	(If your terminal type is xterm, just use vt220.)
