INSTALLATION NOTES for FabBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is FabBSD?
---------------

FabBSD is an open-source, 4.4BSD-like operating system designed for the
numerical control of machinery and instrumentation. FabBSD can be used to
control various types of equipment:

 - Machine tools: CNC milling machines, lathes, routers, lasers
 - Process control: Manipulators, power supplies, relays, valves, heaters
 - Measurement: Optical encoders, thickness gauges, sensors

FabBSD handles system interrupts, process scheduling and floating-point
units differently from general-purpose systems, such that tasks requiring
real-time priority can be performed, without sacrificing the convenience
of a fully functional Unix system.

FabBSD OSREV is derived from OpenBSD and the distribution includes OpenSSH,
Sudo, Binutils, GCC and GDB. FabBSD introduces:

- New devices: atc(4), cnclcd(4), cncstatled(4), encoder(4), estop(4),
               mpg(4), servo(4), spindle(4).
- New system calls and libraries: cnc(3).
- New commands: ngc(1), move(1), boltpattern(1), gerbdrill(1).

Because FabBSD is from Canada, the export of Cryptography pieces (such
as OpenSSH and IPsec) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: FabBSD can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

A comprehensive list of the improvements brought by the OSREV release
is available on the web at http://www.FabBSD.org/OSrev.html.

dnl MACHINE/whatis
dnl A few descriptive words about the port to MACHINE (i.e. what kind
dnl of hardware it runs on, without too much details - MACHINE/hardware
dnl will take care of this).

FabBSD OSREV Release Contents:
------------------------------

The FabBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the .../OSREV
directory, for each of the architectures having an FabBSD OSREV binary
distribution, there is a sub-directory.

FabBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
-------------------------------------------------

includeit(hardware)


Getting the FabBSD System onto Useful Media:
--------------------------------------------

includeit(xfer)


Preparing your System for FabBSD Installation:
----------------------------------------------

includeit(prep)


Installing the FabBSD System:
-----------------------------

includeit(install)


Upgrading a previously-installed FabBSD System:
-----------------------------------------------

includeit(upgrade)


Getting source code for your FabBSD System:
-------------------------------------------

Now that your FabBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

A few methods are provided.  If you have an FabBSD CD-ROM, the source
code is provided.  Otherwise, you can get the pieces over the Internet:
using Subversion or FTP.  For more information, see

	http://www.FabBSD.org/download.html


Using online FabBSD documentation:
----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the "man" distribution
set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation) are denoted by
'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'. For instance, after logging
in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1). To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter instead:

	man 5 passwd

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter:

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly related
man pages will be displayed.


Adding third party software; ``packages'' and ``ports'':

Administrivia:
--------------

Information about the various FabBSD mailing list and proper netiquette
is available at:
	http://FabBSD.org/lists.html.
 
To report bugs, please use our Bugzilla interface at:
	http://FabBSD.org/bugs

Include in as much information about the problem as you can. Good bug
reports {:-include-:} lots of details. Additionally, bug reports can be
sent by mail to:

	bugs@FabBSD.org

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the mailing
lists. Instead, put the material you would have sent up for FTP or HTTP
somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if you'd rather
not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data to those who want
it.
