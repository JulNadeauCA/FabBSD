INSTALLATION NOTES for FabBSD/MACHINE OSREV


What is FabBSD?
---------------

FabBSD is an open-source, 4.4BSD-like operating system designed for
numerical control of machinery and instrumentation. FabBSD can be used to
control various types of equipment:

	- Machine tools: CNC milling machines, lathes, routers, lasers
	- Process control: Power supplies, heaters, chillers, valves, relays
	- Measurement: Optical encoders, thickness gauges, tachometers,
	  thermocouples

Due to the real-time aspect of its kernel, FabBSD is designed for use on
systems dedicated to machine control. Hardware requirements are minimal.
For instance, in a typical computer-aided machining setup, FabBSD running
on a 133MHz 486-class processor will control a set of 350kHz motor drives
with ease, with or without software-based closed-loop control.

FabBSD OSREV integrates a subset of the standard BSD system commands and
utilities from OpenBSD. The distribution also includes Binutils, GCC, gdb,
OpenSSH and Sudo. FabBSD adds programming interfaces such as cnc(3), a set
of command-line utilities and the machctld(8) daemon.

Because FabBSD is from Canada, the export of Cryptography pieces (such
as OpenSSH and IPsec) to the world is not restricted.

(NOTE: FabBSD can not be re-exported from the US once it has entered
the US.  Because of this, take care NOT to get the distribution from
an FTP server in the US if you are outside of Canada and the US.)

A comprehensive list of the improvements brought by the OSREV release
is available on the web at http://www.FabBSD.org/OSrev.html.

dnl MACHINE/whatis
dnl A few descriptive words about the port to MACHINE (i.e. what kind
dnl of hardware it runs on, without too much details - MACHINE/hardware
dnl will take care of this).

FabBSD OSREV Release Contents:
------------------------------

The FabBSD OSREV release is organized in the following way.  In the .../OSREV
directory, for each of the architectures having an FabBSD OSREV binary
distribution, there is a sub-directory.

FabBSD System Requirements and Supported Devices:
-------------------------------------------------

includeit(hardware)


Getting the FabBSD System onto Useful Media:
--------------------------------------------

includeit(xfer)


Preparing your System for FabBSD Installation:
----------------------------------------------

includeit(prep)


Installing the FabBSD System:
-----------------------------

includeit(install)


Upgrading a previously-installed FabBSD System:
-----------------------------------------------

includeit(upgrade)


Getting source code for your FabBSD System:
-------------------------------------------

Now that your FabBSD system is up and running, you probably want to get
access to source code so that you can recompile pieces of the system.

A few methods are provided.  If you have an FabBSD CD-ROM, the source
code is provided.  Otherwise, you can get the pieces over the Internet:
using anonymous CVS, CTM, CVSync or FTP.  For more information, see

	http://www.FabBSD.org/download.html


Using online FabBSD documentation:
----------------------------------

Documentation is available if you first install the manual pages
distribution set.  Traditionally, the UN*X "man pages" (documentation)
are denoted by 'name(section)'.  Some examples of this are

	intro(1),
	man(1),
	apropos(1),
	passwd(1),
	passwd(5) and
	afterboot(8).

The section numbers group the topics into several categories, but three
are of primary interest: user commands are in section 1, file formats
are in section 5, and administrative information is in section 8.

The 'man' command is used to view the documentation on a topic, and is
started by entering 'man [section] topic'.  The brackets [] around the
section should not be entered, but rather indicate that the section is
optional.  If you don't ask for a particular section, the topic with the
least-numbered section name will be displayed.  For instance, after
logging in, enter

	man passwd

to read the documentation for passwd(1).  To view the documentation for
passwd(5), enter

	man 5 passwd

instead.

If you are unsure of what man page you are looking for, enter

	apropos subject-word

where "subject-word" is your topic of interest; a list of possibly
related man pages will be displayed.


Adding third party software; ``packages'' and ``ports'':

Administrivia:
--------------

Information about the various OpenBSD mailing list and proper netiquette
is available at

	http://FabBSD.org/lists.html

To report bugs, use the 'sendbug' command shipped with FabBSD, and fill
in as much information about the problem as you can.  Good bug reports
{:-include-:} lots of details.  Additionally, bug reports can be sent
by mail to:

	bugs@FabBSD.org

Use of 'sendbug' is encouraged, however, because bugs reported with it
are entered into the FabBSD bugs database, and thus can't slip through
the cracks.

As a favor, please avoid mailing huge documents or files to the
mailing lists.  Instead, put the material you would have sent up
for FTP somewhere, then mail the appropriate list about it, or, if
you'd rather not do that, mail the list saying you'll send the data
to those who want it.
