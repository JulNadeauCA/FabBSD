.Dt USBHIDACTION 1
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm usbhidaction
.Nd perform actions according to USB HID controls
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op Fl div
.Fl c Ar config-file
.Fl f Ar device
.Ar arg ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
can be used to execute commands when certain values appear on HID controls.
The normal operation for this program is to read the configuration file
and then become a daemon and execute commands as the HID items specify.
If a read from the HID device fails the program dies; this will make it
die when the USB device is unplugged.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl c Ar config-file
Specify a path name for the config file.
.It Fl d
Toggle the daemon flag.
.It Fl f Ar device
Specify a path name for the device to operate on.
If
.Ar device
is numeric, it is taken to be the USB HID device number.
If it is a relative path, it is taken to be the name of the device under
.Pa /dev .
An absolute path is taken to be the literal device pathname.
.It Fl i
Ignore HID items in the config file that do not exist in the device.
.It Fl v
Be verbose, and do not become a daemon.
.El
.Pp
The config file will be re-read if the process gets a HUP signal.
.Sh CONFIGURATION
The configuration file has a very simple format.
Each line describes an action; if a line begins with a whitespace
it is considered a continuation of the previous line.
Lines beginning with `#' are considered as comments.
.Pp
Each line has three parts: a name of a USB HID item, a value for that item,
and an action.
There must be whitespace between the parts.
.Pp
The item names are similar to those used by
.Xr usbhidctl 1 ,
but each part must be prefixed by its page name.
.Pp
The value is simply a numeric value.
When the item reports this value the action will be performed.
If the value is `*' it will match any value.
.Pp
The action is a normal command that is executed with
.Xr system 3 .
Before it is executed some substitution will occur:
`$n' will be replaced by the nth argument on the
command line, `$V' will be replaced by the numeric value
of the HID item, `$N' will be replaced by the name
of the control, and `$H' will be replaced by the name
of the HID device.
.Sh FILES
.Pa /usr/share/misc/usb_hid_usages
The HID usage table.
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following configuration file can be used to control a pair
of Philips USB speakers with the HID controls on the speakers.
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# Configuration for various Philips USB speakers
Consumer:Consumer_Control.Consumer:Volume_Up			   1
	mixerctl -f $1 -n outputs.master=+1
Consumer:Consumer_Control.Consumer:Volume_Down			   1
	mixerctl -f $1 -n outputs.master=-1
Consumer:Consumer_Control.Consumer:Mute				   1
	mixerctl -f $1 -n outputs.mute=+1
Consumer:Consumer_Control.Consumer:Channel_Top.Microsoft:Base_Up   1
	mixerctl -f $1 -n outputs.bass=+1
Consumer:Consumer_Control.Consumer:Channel_Top.Microsoft:Base_Down 1
	mixerctl -f $1 -n outputs.bass=-1
.Ed
.Pp
A sample invocation using this configuration would be
.Bd -literal -offset indent
$ usbhidaction -f /dev/uhid1 -c conf /dev/mixer1
.Ed

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
command first appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
