.Dt GZSIG 1
.Sh NAME
.Nm gzsig
.Nd gzip signing utility
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm gzsig
.Ic sign
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl f Ar secret_file
.Ar privkey
.Op Ar
.Nm gzsig
.Ic verify
.Op Fl q
.Op Fl f Ar secret_file
.Ar pubkey
.Op Ar
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
embeds or verifies RSA PKCS #1 v2.0 or DSA SHA1 signatures in
.Xr gzip 1
compressed files using SSH identity keys or X509 certificates.
.Pp
The
.Ar file
operands are processed in command-line order.
If
.Ar file
is a single dash
.Pq Sq -
or absent,
.Nm
reads from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f Ar secret_file
Indicates that the passphrase for the key should be read from
.Ar secret_file
instead of being supplied manually.
.It Fl q
Enable quiet mode.
.It Ic sign
Sign the input using the private key in
.Ar privkey .
.It Ic verify
Verify the signature using the public key in
.Ar pubkey .
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
utility exits 0 on success or \*(Gt0 if an error occurred.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Sign
.Ar file1
and
.Ar file2
with the SSH2 identity key in
.Ar ~/.ssh/id_rsa :
.Pp
.Dl $ gzsig sign ~/.ssh/id_rsa file1 file2
.Pp
Sign
.Ar file1
with the SSH2 identity key, saving the signed file in
.Ar file2 :
.Pp
.Dl $ gzsig sign ~/.ssh/id_rsa \*(Ltfile1 \*(Gtfile2
.Pp
Verify the signature on
.Ar file1
using the SSL certificate in
.Ar /etc/ssl/server.crt :
.Pp
.Dl $ gzsig verify /etc/ssl/server.crt \*(Ltfile1
