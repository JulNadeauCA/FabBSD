.Sh NAME
.Nm encrypt
.Nd encrypt passwords from the command line or standard input
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm encrypt
.Op Fl km
.Op Fl b Ar rounds
.Op Fl c Ar class
.Op Fl p | Ar string
.Op Fl s Ar salt
.Nm makekey
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
prints the encrypted form of
.Ar string
to the standard output.
This is mostly useful for encrypting passwords from within scripts.
.Pp
When invoked as
.Nm makekey ,
a single combined key and salt are read from standard
input and the DES encrypted result is written to standard output without a
terminating newline.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar rounds
Encrypt the string using Blowfish hashing with the specified
.Ar rounds .
.It Fl c Ar class
Use the cipher type specified in the given user login class.
See
.Xr login.conf 5
for more information.
.It Fl k
Run in
.Nm makekey
compatible mode.
.It Fl m
Encrypt the string using MD5.
.It Fl p
Prompt for a single string with echo turned off.
.It Fl s Ar salt
Encrypt the string using DES, with the specified
.Ar salt .
.El
.Pp
If no
.Ar string
is specified,
.Nm
reads one string per line from standard input, encrypting each one
with the chosen algorithm from above.
In the case where no specific algorithm or specific user login class was given
as a command line option, the algorithm specified in the default class in
.Pa /etc/login.conf
will be used.
.Pp
For MD5 and Blowfish, a new random salt is automatically generated for each
password.
.Pp
Specifying the
.Ar string
on the command line should be discouraged; using the
standard input is more secure.
