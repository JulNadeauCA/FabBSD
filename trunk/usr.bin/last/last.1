.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm last
.Nd indicate last logins of users, ttys, and hosts
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm last
.Op Fl csT
.Op Fl d Ar date
.Op Fl f Ar file
.Op Fl h Ar host
.Op Fl n Ar number
.Op Fl t Ar tty
.Op Ar user ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility will either list the sessions of specified
.Ar users ,
.Ar ttys ,
and
.Ar hosts ,
in reverse time order,
or list the users logged in at a specified snapshot date and time
in reverse time order.
Each line of output contains
the user name, the tty from which the session was conducted, any
hostname, the start and stop times for the session, and the duration
of the session.
If the session is still continuing or was cut short by
a crash or shutdown,
.Nm
will so indicate.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width "-n number"
.It Fl c
Calculates the total time displayed and prints it after the output.
.It Fl d Ar date
Specify the snapshot date and time.
All users logged in at the snapshot date and time will
be reported.
This may be used with the
.Fl f
option to derive the results from stored wtmp files.
When this argument is provided, all other options except for
.Fl f
and
.Fl n
are ignored.
The argument should be in the form
.Dq [[[CC]YY]MMDD]hhmm[.SS]
where each pair of letters represents the following:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact -offset indent
.It Ar CC
The first two digits of the year (the century).
.It Ar YY
The second two digits of the year.
If
.Dq YY
is specified, but
.Dq CC
is not, a value for
.Dq YY
between 69 and 99 results in a
.Dq CC
value of 19.
Otherwise, a
.Dq CC
value of 20 is used.
.It Ar MM
Month of the year, from 1 to 12.
.It Ar DD
Day of the month, from 1 to 31.
.It Ar hh
Hour of the day, from 0 to 23.
.It Ar mm
Minute of the hour, from 0 to 59.
.It Ar SS
Second of the minute, from 0 to 61.
.El
.Pp
All but the
.Dq hh
and
.Dq mm
letter pairs are optional.
If the
.Dq CC
and
.Dq YY
letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current
year.
If the
.Dq MM
and
.Dq DD
letter pairs are not specified, the values default to the current
month and day.
If the
.Dq SS
letter pair is not specified, the value defaults to 0.
.It Fl f Ar file
.Nm
reads the file
.Ar file
instead of the default,
.Pa /var/log/wtmp .
.It Fl h Ar host
.Ar host
names may be names or internet numbers.
.It Fl n Ar number
Limits the report to
.Ar number
lines.
The format
.Fl Ns Ar number
is also supported,
but is deprecated.
.It Fl s
Display time values in seconds since the Epoch, instead of formatted dates.
.It Fl T
Display better time information, including seconds.
.It Fl t Ar tty
Specify the
.Ar tty .
tty names may be given fully or abbreviated, for example,
.Ic last -t 03
is
equivalent to
.Ic last -t tty03 .
.El
.Pp
If
multiple arguments are given, and a snapshot time is not specified, the
information which applies to any of the
arguments is printed, e.g.,
.Ic last root -t console
would list all of
.Li root Ns 's
sessions as well as all sessions on the console terminal.
If no users, hostnames, or terminals are specified,
.Nm
prints a record of
all logins and logouts.
.Pp
The pseudo-user
.Dq reboot
logs in at reboots of the system; thus
.Ic last reboot
will give an indication of mean time between reboot.
.Pp
If
.Nm
is interrupted, it indicates to what date the search has
progressed.
If interrupted with a quit signal,
.Nm
indicates how
far the search has progressed and then continues.
