.Sh NAME
.Nm lock
.Nd reserve a terminal
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm lock
.Op Fl np
.Op Fl a Ar style
.Op Fl t Ar timeout
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
requests a password from the user, reads it again for verification
and then will normally not relinquish the terminal until the password is
repeated.
There are two other conditions under which it will terminate: it
will timeout after some interval of time and it may be killed by someone
with the appropriate privileges.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar style
The specified BSD Authentication login
.Ar style
(as specified in
.Pa /etc/login.conf )
will be used to authenticate the user.
If the particular
.Ar style
requires a challenge/response handshake or a special prompt, the
user may enter the name of the
.Ar style
to get the standard prompt for that
.Ar style .
.It Fl n
Don't use a timeout value.
Terminal will be locked forever.
.It Fl p
A password is not requested, instead the user's current login password
is used.
If the user has an S/Key key, they may also use it to unlock the terminal.
To do this the user should enter
.Qq s/key
at the unlock
.Dq Key:
prompt.
The user will then be issued an S/Key
challenge to which they may respond with a six-word S/Key one-time
password.
.It Fl t Ar timeout
The time limit (default 15 minutes) is changed to
.Ar timeout
minutes.
