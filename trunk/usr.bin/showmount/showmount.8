.Sh NAME
.Nm showmount
.Nd show remote NFS mounts on host
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm showmount
.Op Fl 3ade
.Op Ar host
.Sh DESCRIPTION

shows status information about the
.Tn NFS
server on
.Ar host .
By default it prints the names of all hosts that have
.Tn NFS
file systems mounted
on the host.
See
.%T "NFS: Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094,
Appendix A,
and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I,
for a detailed description of the protocol.
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl 3
Use mount protocol Version 3, compatible with NFS Version 3.
.It Fl a
List all mount points in the form:
.Ar host : Ns Ar dirpath .
.It Fl d
List directory paths of mount points instead of hosts.
.It Fl e

.Ar host Ns 's
exports list.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr mount 8 ,
.Xr mountd 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The mount daemon running on the server only has an idea of the actual mounts,
since the
.Tn NFS
server is stateless.
.Nm
will only display the information
as accurately as the mount daemon reports it.
