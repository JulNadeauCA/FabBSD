There is one special construction with subscripts
and superscripts that you have to be aware of, although
it almost always does what you want automatically.
When something has both a subscript and a superscript,
it is usually printed as
.EQ
x sub i sup j
.EN
instead of
.EQ
{x sub i} sup j
.EN
To produce this effect, with the superscript _____above the
subscript instead of to the right, you have to type
the subscript ______before the superscript, like this:

   .EQ
   x sub i sup j
   .EN

That's all there is to it.

Modify "Example" to produce the following output, then type "ready".
.pl 1
#once #create Ref

.EQ
x sub ij sup kmn = y sub i sub j
.EN
.pl 1
#once #create Example
