The next neqn operation is called "sqrt" - it makes
square root signs over things, like this:
.EQ
sqrt a+b
.EN
(They don't look very good on a terminal, unfortunately.)
This one is very easy - to print the line above, you
say
   .EQ
   sqrt a+b
   .EN
The "sqrt" operates on the first thing it finds
so if you want something more complicated, like
.EQ
sqrt {pi +1}
.EN
you have to use braces to enclose the entire
thing.  This one was printed with
   .EQ
   sqrt {pi +1}
   .EN
And that's all there is to sqrt.

Modify "Example" so it looks like this, then type "ready".
