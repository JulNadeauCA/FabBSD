#print
One thing to keep in mind, although it generally
isn't going to affect you, is that the quote "
is a delimiter just like blank or tilde -
it turns off subscripts and superscripts, and so
on. 
Experiment a bit, and decide if
  e sup "{t}"
is the same as
  e sup "{"t"}"
Type yes if they are the same, no if they are different.
