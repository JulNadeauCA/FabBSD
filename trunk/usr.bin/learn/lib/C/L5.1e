#print
Write a program that counts the number of vowels 
in its input (excluding 'y').  Don't forget to define
the value of EOF at the beginning of your program.
#once #create Ref
This line contains some vowels, including
the letter 'y'. It also has a capital letter, I think.
#user
a.out <Ref >test
grep 28 test >/dev/null
#succeed
Here is one solution.

 #include <stdio.h>

main()
{
	int nv, c;

	nv = 0;
	while ((c = getchar()) != EOF)
		if (c=='a' || c=='e' || c=='i' || c=='o' || c=='u'
		 || c=='A' || c=='E' || c=='I' || c=='O' || c=='U')
			nv++;
	printf("%d\n", nv);
}
#fail
Did you remember capital letters?
#log
#next
