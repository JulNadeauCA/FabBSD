#print
(Section 1.9 -- read 1.6-1.8 too.)
Write a program that removes trailing blanks
and tabs from each line of input, and deletes
entirely blank lines.  To make your job easier,
you can use the function getline; its source
is in getline.c.
Type read when you are done.
#once #create Ref
  This  file  contains
some trailing     		
blanks 
and tabs


	
 	 
and some empty lines.
#once #create Ref1
  This  file  contains
some trailing
blanks
and tabs
and some empty lines.
#once cp %s/getline.c .
#user
a.out <Ref >test
#cmp test Ref1
