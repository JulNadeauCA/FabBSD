#print
With your 'cc' command you can give the name of
an object file to be loaded with your program.
For example
   cc x.c y.o
will load the previously compiled program 'y' along with
the program 'x' to be compiled now.

The file "getnum.o" contains a subroutine "getnum" which
reads an integer and returns its value.
Write a program which reads a number and decides
whether or not it is a multiple of 23.  If so print
"yes" and otherwise print "no".
Compile and test; then type "ready".
#once #create Ref1
23000
#once #create Ref2
23001
#once cp %s/getnum.o .
#user
a.out <Ref1 >z1
a.out <Ref2 >z2
grep yes z1 >/dev/null && grep no z2 >/dev/null
#succeed
/*	One way: */

main() {
	if (getnum()%23 == 0)
		printf("yes\n");
	else
		printf("no\n");
}
#log
#next
