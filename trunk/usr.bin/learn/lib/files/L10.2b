#print
You can remove several files at once with the "rm" command.
And you can use the familiar "*" and "?" characters
to abbreviate several file names.  BUT BE CAREFUL -
"rm" is irreversible, and it is all too easy to type something
like "rm *" and get rid of all your files.
In this directory are two files named 
"part1" and "part2".
Remove both; then type "ready".
#create part1
#create part2
#user
test ! -r part1 && test ! -r part2
#log
#next
