#print
You can use the [] characters anywhere you want
in a file name.  For example,
 ls a[bc]d
would match abd or acd, right?
What is the command that finds out how
many files are named "ax" or "bx"?
Type that command, then "ready".
#create ax
#create bx
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match ls [ab]x
#log
#next
