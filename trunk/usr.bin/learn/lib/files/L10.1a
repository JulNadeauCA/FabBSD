#print
When you are done with something, you will want to know
how to get rid of the file it is on.  The command
for that is "rm" (remove).  For example
  rm junk
throws away the file named "junk".  Once it
is gone, it is really gone - there is no way
to "undo" a remove command.  Hence this command
should be used with caution.
In this directory there is one file named
for a baseball player.  Remove it.
Then type "ready".
