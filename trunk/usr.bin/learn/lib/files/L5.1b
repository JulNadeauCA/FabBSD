#print
Will the name
  xyz
be selected by the pattern
  x?
in an "ls" command?
Type "yes" or "no".  If you
have trouble, there is such a file
in the current directory,
so you can find out by trial and error.
(For example, you might do an ordinary "ls"
and then try "ls x?" and compare the results.)
#create xyz
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match no
