#print
As an example more complicated than you will
probably ever need, consider
  ?[a-c]*
which matches what?  Well the first character
can be anything; the second must be a, b, or c; and
nothing matters thereafter.    So it matches
 aaa
 abc
 xa
 3c25
but not
 a
 ghi
and so forth.
Will it match
 %a25
Try some experiments, then type yes or no.
#create %a25
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match yes
#log
#next
