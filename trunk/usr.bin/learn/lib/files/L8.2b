#print
The command
 ls [aeiou]*.c
will match all but one of the following names.
  e.c
  alpha.c
  edward
  u23.c
Which one?  Type "answer NAME" where NAME
is the file that doesn't match.  You can experiment
first, as usual.
#create alpha.c
#create e.c
#create edward
#create u23.c
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match edward
#log
#next
