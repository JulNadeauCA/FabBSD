#print
Sometimes you want to request one of a limited
range of characters.  This is possible with an
expression like
  [a-d]
which matches a, b, c, or d.  Thus, to take
some combinations
  ab[c-f]
matches
  abc, abd, abe, abf
Try typing "ls a[0-9]"
and see how many files it matches.  Type that
number in the form "answer N".
#create a0
#create a1
#create a5
#create ax
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match 3
#log
#next
