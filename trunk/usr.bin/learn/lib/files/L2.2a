#print
The "mv" command changes the names of files.
For example, "mv thomas james" changes the
name of the file "thomas" to be "james".

There is a file in the current directory named
"thomas".  Change that file to have the
name "james".  Then type "ready".
(The "mv" command, by the way, is like many
UNIX commands in that it is silent unless there is an error.)
