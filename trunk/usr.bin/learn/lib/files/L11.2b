#print
Contrast 
 cp old new
with 
 mv old new
as commands; both cause "new" to appear,
but "cp" does not remove "old".
Both, by the way, destroy anything
that happened to be around named "new".
There is a file in this directory
whose name ends in "x".  Use "ls"
with the "*x" construction to find its name;
then copy it to file "new", and type "ready".
