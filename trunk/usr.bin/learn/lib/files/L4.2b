#print
You can inquire about several files at once
with the "ls" command.  If you type, for example,
   ls fee fi fo fum
you will be told which of the four files "fee", "fi", "fo",
and "fum" exist.  In the current directory only one
of the files "grover", "gerald", or "george" exists.
Find out which one; then rename it "grant".
Type "ready" when you are done.
