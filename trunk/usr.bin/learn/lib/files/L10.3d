You can also use "*" and "?" with
the "rm" command.  BUT BE VERY CAREFUL
since, for example, "rm *" will throw away
ALL the files in a directory.
In this directory are some files named
chunk1, chunk2, chunk3 and chunk4.
Get rid of them.  Then type "ready".
#create X1
#
ls >X2
#create chunk1
#create chunk2
#create chunk3
#create chunk4
#user
ls >X1
#cmp X1 X2
#log
#next
