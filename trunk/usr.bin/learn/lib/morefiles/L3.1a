#print
The notation ">" can be used by most programs to capture
output on a file.  For example, 

   cat henry >james

makes a copy of "henry" in the file "james"; in fact this is
essentially identical to

   cp henry james

"cat" is a bit more flexible, though, since you can concatenate
several files onto one output.  Remember that

   cat tom dick harry

copies all three files onto the terminal?
In this directory is a file named "john".
Make a file called "mary" that contains ___two copies of "john".
Type "ready" when you're done.
#create john

men to come to the aid of their

#create X1
Now is the time for all good
men to come to the aid of their
party
