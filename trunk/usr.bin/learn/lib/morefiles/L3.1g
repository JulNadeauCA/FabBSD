#print
This exercise combines several things you've learned already.
In this directory is a file containing a list of words.
Collect all of the words that contain "ly" into a file
called "lywords".  (What program does that?)
Then use "pr" to make another file called "neatly"
that contains the list of words printed in one column.
Type "ready" when you have made both files.
