those lines that contain occurrences of a pattern:
  grep -v pat files...
prints all the lines in files... that don't contain
any "pat".
How many of the lines in "bio*" don't contain "the"?
Type "answer N", where N is the number of lines.

   Roughly speaking, your eye is made of three balls, or layers,
fitted tightly one inside the other.  the tough white outermost
layer's function is to protect the others.  the middle layer gives
the front of your eye its brown, gray, or blue color.  The inside
of this layer is dark and full of tiny blood vessels.  The innermost
layer, called the retina, is made of very special nerve cells that
are sensitive to light and color.  A nerve cord connects the retina
of each eye to your brain.
   The front of your eye's two outer layers (the cornea) is clear,
or open, to let light enter.

   We do not know when life began on the earth, and it seems likely
that the answer to this question will remain forever hidden from us.
What we do know is that it was some 500 million years ago when the
plants and animals of early geologic history had reached a stage of
development where they produced hard parts capable of being preserved
as fossils.
   At this distant date there seemingly was no land life; all life
was in the sea.  Moreover, there were no vertebrates, or backboned
animals, living -- at least none of sufficient complexity that they
left hard structures to be preserved in the form of fossils.
