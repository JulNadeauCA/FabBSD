#print
The pr command has a number of other capabilities besides simple
printing of files.  Probably the most useful is that it can do
multi-column printing.  This is controlled by an optional
argument:
  pr -3 filenames
will print in 3-column format, and 
  pr -5 filenames
prints in five columns.  You can use any number in place of 3 and 5,
although as you get more columns they become narrower
so things will fit.
Notice that the optional argument comes ______before the files names.

In this directory there is a list of words.  Find the list, print
it in two columns, and find out what word appears at the top
of the second column.  Type "answer WORD", where WORD
is the word you decide on.
