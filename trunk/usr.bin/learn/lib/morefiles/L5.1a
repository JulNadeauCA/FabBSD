#print
If you think back over some of the exercises you've done
so far in this course, they have involved collecting the
output of one program (like "cat" or "grep" or "ls") in
a file, then using that file as the input to another
program, like "pr" or "wc" or "grep".
For example, you could use "ls" and "wc" to _____count
the number of files in a directory.  Do that now,
then type "answer N", where N is the number of files.
#create X2
#create X1
#create this
#create stuff
#create foo
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
ls | %s/../lcount >X1
tail -1 .copy >X2
#cmp X1 X2
#log
#next
