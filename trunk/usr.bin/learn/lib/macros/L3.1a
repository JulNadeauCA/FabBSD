The file "decl" began with ".PP".  All files sent
to -ms MUST begin with a "-ms" command line.  You can
tell these command lines, in general, because they
begin with a period and have only capital letters on them.
The ".PP" command indicates a new paragraph.
So to add another paragraph to a file, you put a ".PP"
in front and then type in the new text.  Here is the
next paragraph of the declaration of independence.  Add
it to the end of the file "decl" that you've been working
with.  You can do that most easily by picking up the text
from file "para2", or you can type it in again.  It is
not necessary to keep every word on exactly
the line it was, since the program will rearrange them.
But the ".PP" must be on a line by itself.  Then
run off the new version.

.PP
When in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another, and to assume among the 
powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
.PP
We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.  That whenever
any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
