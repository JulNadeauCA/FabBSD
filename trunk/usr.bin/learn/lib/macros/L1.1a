WARNING: This course was written for UNIX in 1979, not 1999,
and has not yet been updated. Some details may be way out of date!
In particular, Berkeley UNIX includes the -me macros, which are
preferred over -ms, but we don't yet have a course on the -me macros.

This script deals with the use of the "-ms" macro
package to produce Bell Laboratories style documents.
Before trying it, you should be familiar with the
editor.  To test that, please enter the file
typed below, _______exactly __as __is, into file "decl".  Then
type "ready".

When in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another, and to assume among the
powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.
