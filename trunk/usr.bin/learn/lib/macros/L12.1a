With a TM you want a cover sheet.  The cover sheet doesn't look too
nice when printed on a computer terminal, but you should
know how to set it up so that you can put it on the typesetter,
which does an attractive job of imitating the official  printed
form.  Basically you must make two changes to get a cover sheet
with normal formatting.  First, you should add to each .AU line
the author's room number and extension.  For example,
  .AU "MH 2C-569" "6377"
  M. E. Lesk
indicates that Lesk's room is MH 2C-569 and his extension is 6377.
The room number is enclosed in quotes to indicate that it is one
unit, even though it contains a blank.  The quotes around
the extension are harmless but unnecessary.  Also, you
must add the command
  .CS 1 2 3 4 5 6
after the ".AE" line.  The six numbers are (from left to right)
the number of pages of text, number of pages of "other",
the total number of pages, the number of references, the number
of figures and the number of tables.  Try editing
the usual file "decl" to indicate that Mr. Jefferson's
room number is MH 2A-111 and his extension is 1776.
Request a cover sheet with the above meaningless numbers,
just to see where they go.  Then run off the document again.

When in the course of human events, it becomes
necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have
connected them with another, and to assume among the 
powers of the earth the separate and equal station to which
the laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent
respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should
declare the causes which impel them to the separation.

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men
are created equal, that they are endowed by their creator
with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty,
and the pursuit of happiness.  That to secure these rights,
governments are instituted among men, deriving their just
powers from the consent of the governed.  That whenever
any form of government becomes destructive of these ends,
it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and
to institute new government, laying its foundation on such
principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them
shall seem most likely to effect their safety and happiness.
