#print
The editor accepts commands one per line,
just like the other programs in UNIX; but its
commands are unique to it.  The
only command present in every editing session is the
last one, 'q' (quit) which returns to the normal
command interpreting program.  I'm going to put
you in the editor.  Type 'q' to leave,
and then type "ready" when you get the '$' from
the normal command handler.
