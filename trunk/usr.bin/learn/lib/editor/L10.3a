#print
Often you want to refer to the last line
of the file.  You don't have to know the number
of lines in the file to do that; there
is a special address, "$", that always
refers to the last line.  So you
can print the last line of a file with $p;
try that, then type w, q and ready as usual.
#create Ref
This is the end of the file and the line you should print.
