#print
Once in a while you want to add text just before
a certain line, rather than just after it.  For this purpose
there is a command 'i' (insert) which is just like 'a'
except that the new material goes before the addressed line,
instead of after it.  For example,
  3i
is the same as
  2a
Try this sequence, which prints the editor buffer before
and after the insertion, to see what happens.
