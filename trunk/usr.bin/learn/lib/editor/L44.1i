#print
One last one with "\".  Add the following to
the end of the first line in file "temp",
separated by a single blank.

/* &"\n" isn't &'\n' */

You can do it by re-typing the line, but it's
a nice exercise to use "s".
Type "ready" after you have re-written the file.
#create Ref
p = &"\n"; /* &"\n" isn't &'\n' */
#create temp
p = &"\n";
#user
#cmp temp Ref
#log
#next
