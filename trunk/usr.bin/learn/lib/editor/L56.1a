#print
Is there just as easy a way of
printing the immediately preceding line?
Not quite, but almost.  The line

-

will print the line just before the line you
are on.  What's the equivalent command
in terms of "." and "p"?  Type "answer COMMAND"
when you figure it out.  Again, you can experiment
first; the same file named "pres" is in this directory.
#create pres
