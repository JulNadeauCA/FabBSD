#print
You can delete several lines at once by giving a range
of addresses with the 'd' command.  For example, the sequence

ed howto
2,5d
w
q

will delete lines 2 through 5 of the file "howto" and write
the shorter material on the file "new".  Try that.  Then say

cat howto
cat new

to see the differences; then type "ready".
