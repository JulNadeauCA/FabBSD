#print
Don't forget the use of arithmetic combinations
with the "p" command.  For example, the
current line is "." and the next line is ".+1";
do you see how to print the current line and the
next line with one command?  Think of it as "print
from this line to the next line".  Type "answer COMMAND"
where COMMAND is what your line with "p" will look like.
