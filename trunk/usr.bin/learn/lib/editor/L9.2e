#print
You can also employ addresses using arithmetic with
this kind of command.  For example, what "p" command
would you type to print from line 2 to the line
before the current line of the file?  Remember what
the line before the current line is: 
  .-1
right?
Type "answer COMMAND" where COMMAND is the specified
"p" command.
