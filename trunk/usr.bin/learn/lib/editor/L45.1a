#print
There is one last class of substitutions that
you should know about:  converting one line 
into two or more by substituting a newline
into the middle.  Suppose you want to split the
line
   Now is the time for all good men
into
   Now is the time
   for all good men
without re-typing.  The substitute command is
   s/time /time\
   /
The backslash indicates that a newline is to be
inserted at that point; the rest of the "s"
command is actually typed on a new line.

Practice by splitting the first line in file
"btl" into

using the "s" command as illustrated above.
Be sure to delete the comma and space properly.
Re-write the file, then type "ready".
