#print
Sometimes you want to recognize a string of characters
only if they appear at the beginning of the line.
The character '^' is used for this purpose.  The
command
  s/^ab/xy/
will change "ab" to "xy" only if "ab" begins the line.
Try the following and watch what it does.

ed file

1,2s/^ab/xy/
