#print
Remember the procedures with '*' for changing one or more
of something into one something.  Pick up the file
"sloppy" and on every line, whereever there are several
blanks in a row change them to one blank.  This can be done
with one command; it is a very common task. Then rewrite the file
and type "ready".

It seems that medieval art
 Alone retains its zest
To charm and please its devotees
 We've done our level best
We're not quite sure that all we do
 Has the Early English ring
But as far as we can tell
 It's something like this sort of thing.
