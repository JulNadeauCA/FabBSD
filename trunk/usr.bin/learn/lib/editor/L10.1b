You can of course combine the various sorts
of line addresses we have been using.
Suppose the last line is line 6; then $ is
line 6, and $-1 is line 5.  Thus $-1 is the
next to last line, and 
  1,$-1p
prints all but the last line of a file.  Again,
I'll put you in the editor: print the last three lines
of the file.  End with the usual w, q, and ready.

I hope you realized the addresses had to be
  $-2,$p
to get the last three lines.
