#print
Each 'w' command typed so far has written the edited material
back on the same file that it came from originally.
This can be changed by giving a filename on the 'w' command:
  w camden
will write the current editor buffer
on file 'camden'.  What does the following
sequence of commands do?
   ed old
   w new
   q
As you can see, it picks up file 'old', and
writes it on file 'new'.  It has the same effect
as
   cp old new
does.

In this directory there is a file named "old".
Copy that file to file "new" with the editor, using
the commands given above.  Check by printing
both files with "cat" that they are the same.
Type "ready" when done.
