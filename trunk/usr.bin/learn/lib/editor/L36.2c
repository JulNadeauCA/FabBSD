#print
On the right side of a substitute, none of the other
special characters mean anything unusual.  Thus, if you wanted to
replace the letter 'a' by an asterisk, for example, the obvious
com and would work:

s/a/*/p

Try, in the file "data", replacing the comma on the last line
with a period.  Then rewrite the file and type "ready".

You really shouldn't be
printing all of this file -
did you forget that '$' is
the address of the last
line of a file?
Use that instead of printing everything.
