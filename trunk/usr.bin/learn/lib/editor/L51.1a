#print
You can also use relative addresses of the +1 or -1
sort with context searches.  For example, to
print the line after a line containing "cat",
you can say
  /cat/+1p
How would you print the line before the next line
containing the word "help" at the beginning
of the line?  Try some experiments if you want,
but in the end type "answer COMMAND" where COMMAND
is the correct command to do that.
#copyin
#user
#uncopyin
#match /^help/-1p
#match /^help/-1
#match /^help/-
#match /^help/-p
#succeed
The "p" isn't necessary, of course.
#cmp X1 X2
#log
#next
