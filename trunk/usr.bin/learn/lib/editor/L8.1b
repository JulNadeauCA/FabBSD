#print
You can also use "-" in addresses.  For example,
the line before the current line is line ".-1"
and can be printed with ".-1p" or even just ".-1".
How would you print the line two lines before the current
line?  Type "answer COMMAND" where COMMAND is
the command you would type to print that line.
