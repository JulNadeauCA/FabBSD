#print
For symmetry, you can use

+

instead of either ".+1p" or an empty
line (just a newline).  The only advantage
that + has is that you can repeat it:

++

prints the second following line, and 

+++

the third.  The same is true of -.
If the current line is line number 10,
what line number is -- going to be?
(Hint:  you can find out by editing a file
such as "pres", saying "10p", and then
saying "--", and then saying ".=" - remember
the "=" command?)
When you find out, type "answer N" where
N is the number.
