#print
Perhaps the most powerful editor command is the 'g'
(global) command.  This command selects sets of lines
on which other commands are executed.  For example,
  g/abc/p
prints all lines on which 'abc' appears.  In this directory
is a file "story".  Print all lines on which the word
"of" appears.  Then leave the editor and type "ready".

   The people of the United States are in a sense becoming a nation

#create story
   The people of the United States are in a sense becoming a nation
on a tiger.  They must learn to consume more and more or, they are
warned, their magnificent economic machine may turn and devour them.
They must be induced to step up their individual consumption higher
and higher, whether they have any pressing need for the goods or
not.  Their ever-expanding economy demands it.
   If modifications are forced upon the private-enterprise system
of the United States in the future, it will be because that system
did too good a job of filling many of the needs of the people.
