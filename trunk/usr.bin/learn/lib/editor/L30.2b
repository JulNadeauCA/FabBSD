#print
In this directory is a file 'pres' whose first line says
'harry' where it should say 'george'.  Fix it using the
substitute command to change 'harry' into 'george'.  You should
use the 'p' command to print the line before and after, checking
that the change took place.  Then rewrite the file and
type 'ready'.
