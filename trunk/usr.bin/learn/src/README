Learn was originally written by Mike Lesk with some contributions
from Brian Kernighan.  The paper in the /usr/share/doc/usd/02.learn
directory dates from the second version of learn, around 1979.

This version of learn has been resurrected from the original V7
source and edited enough that the source compiles and the
lessons can be executed.  We have made no attempt to update the
lessons, nor to fix some of the glaring problems with the code.
Think of it as a historical document, not a polished system.
A historical document, that is, describing code that once
worked fine.  It sort of limps along now, but there are
some things that don't work right.  Caveat emptor.

Code warmed over at OpenBSD, September, 1998.
