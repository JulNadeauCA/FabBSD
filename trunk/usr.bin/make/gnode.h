 * The structure for an individual graph node. Each node has several
 * pieces of data associated with it.
 *	1) the name of the target it describes
 *	2) the location of the target file in the file system.
 *	3) the type of operator used to define its sources (qv. parse.c)
 *	4) whether it is involved in this invocation of make
 *	5) whether the target has been remade
 *	6) whether any of its children has been remade
 *	7) the number of its children that are, as yet, unmade
 *	8) its modification time
 *	9) the modification time of its youngest child (qv. make.c)
 *	10) a list of nodes for which this is a source
 *	11) a list of nodes on which this depends
 *	12) a list of nodes that depend on this, as gleaned from the
 *	    transformation rules.
 *	13) a list of nodes of the same name created by the :: operator
 *	14) a list of nodes that must be made (if they're made) before
 *	    this node can be, but that do no enter into the datedness of
 *	    this node.
 *	15) a list of nodes that must be made (if they're made) after
 *	    this node is, but that do not depend on this node, in the
 *	    normal sense.
 *	16) a Lst of ``local'' variables that are specific to this target
 *	   and this target only (qv. var.c [$@ $< $?, etc.])
 *	17) a Lst of strings that are commands to be given to a shell
 *	   to create this target.
