.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
program is a compact disc control utility,
with support for playing audio CDs and TAO CD writing.
.Pp
If no command is given,
.Nm
enters interactive mode, reading commands from the standard input.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Xo
.Fl d
.Ar host : Ns Ar port
.Xc
Specifies a CDDB host
.Bq default: freedb.freedb.org:cddb .
.It Fl f Ar device
Specifies the name of the CD device, such as
.Pa /dev/rcd0c
or
.Pa mcd0 .
Both absolute and relative paths to
.Pa /dev
filenames are possible;
the raw partition name is added if needed.
.It Fl s
Silent mode.
Do not print table headers or human-readable comments.

.El
.Pp
The available commands are listed below.

.It Ic cdplay Op Ar track1-trackN ...

Unlike
.Ic play ,
the CD player need not be connected to an audio device;
instead it rips tracks from disk and outputs audio data to
.Pa /dev/audio .
Both individual tracks and track ranges may be specified.
If range is specified in descending order tracks will be played in descending order.
If the first value in the range is omitted, tracks from first track on disk to the specified one will be played.
If the last value in the range is omitted, tracks from the specified track to the last track on disk will be played.
.It Ic cdrip Op Ar track1-trackN ...
Rip specified tracks from disk.
Audio tracks are saved as WAVE sound files.
All tracks will be saved in the current working directory.

command.
.It Ic close
