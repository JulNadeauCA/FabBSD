.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
initializes the system so you can use S/Key one-time passwords to log in.
The program will ask you to enter a secret passphrase which is used by
.Xr skey 1
to generate one-time passwords:
enter a phrase of several words in response.
After the S/Key database
has been updated you can log in using either your regular password
or using S/Key one-time passwords.
.Pp
.Nm
requires you to type a secret passphrase, so it should be used
only on a secure terminal.
For example, on the console of a
workstation or over an encrypted network session.
If you are using
.Nm
while logged in over an untrusted network, follow the instructions
given below with the
.Fl s
option.
.Pp
Before initializing an S/Key entry, the user must authenticate
using either a standard password or an S/Key challenge.
To use a one-time password for initial authentication,
.Ic skeyinit -a skey
can be used.
The user will then be presented with the standard
S/Key challenge and allowed to proceed if it is correct.
.Pp
.Nm
prints a sequence number and a one-time password.
This password can't be used to log in; one-time passwords should be
generated using
.Xr skey 1
first.
The one-time password printed by
.Nm
can be used to verify if the right passphrase has been given to
.Xr skey 1 .
The one-time password with the corresponding sequence number printed by
.Xr skey 1
should match the one printed by
.Nm .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a Ar auth-type
Before an S/Key entry can be initialised,
the user must authenticate themselves to the system.
This option allows the authentication type to be specified, such as
.Dq krb5 ,
.Dq passwd ,
or
.Dq skey .
.It Fl C
Converts from the old-style
.Pa /etc/skeykeys
database to a new-style database where user records are stored in the
.Pa /etc/skey
directory.
If an entry already exists in the new-style database it will not
be overwritten.
.It Fl D
Disables access to the S/Key database.
Only the superuser may use the
.Fl D
option.
.It Fl E
Enables access to the S/Key database.
Only the superuser may use the
.Fl E
option.
.It Fl md4 | md5 | rmd160 | sha1
Selects the hash algorithm:
MD4, MD5, RMD-160 (160-bit Ripe Message Digest),
or SHA1 (NIST Secure Hash Algorithm Revision 1).
.It Fl n Ar count
Start the
.Nm skey
sequence at
.Ar count
(default is 100).
.It Fl r
Removes the user's S/Key entry.
.It Fl s
Secure mode.
The user is expected to have already used a secure
machine to generate the first one-time password.
Without the
.Fl s
option the system will assume you are directly connected over secure
communications and prompt you for your secret passphrase.
The
.Fl s
option also allows one to set the seed and count for complete
control of the parameters.
.Pp
When the
.Fl s
option is specified,
.Nm
will try to authenticate the user via S/Key, instead of the default listed in
.Pa /etc/login.conf .
If a user has no entry in the S/Key database, an alternate authentication
type must be specified via the
.Fl a
option
(see above).
Please note that entering a password or passphrase in plain text
defeats the purpose of using
.Dq secure
mode.
.Pp
You can use
.Ic skeyinit -s
in combination with the
.Nm skey
command to set the seed and count if you do not like the defaults.
To do this run
.Ic skeyinit -s
in one window and put in your count and seed, then run
.Xr skey 1
in another window to generate the correct 6 English words for that
count and seed.
You can then "cut-and-paste" or type the words into the
.Nm
window.
.It Fl x
Displays one-time passwords in hexadecimal instead of ASCII.
.It Ar user
The username to be changed/added.
By default the current user is operated on.

Reminder - Only use this method if you are directly connected
           or have an encrypted channel.  If you are using telnet,
           hit return now and use skeyinit -s.
