.Sh NAME
.Nm lkkbd
.Nd LK200/LK400 keyboard driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "lkkbd0 at dz0 line 0 " Pq "VAXstation"
.Cd "lkkbd0 at qsc0 line 2" Pq "VXT2000"
.Cd "wskbd* at lkkbd?"
.Cd "option LKKBD_LAYOUT=XXX"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for DEC LK201 and LK401 keyboards connected to
.Xr dz 4
or
.Xr qsc 4
serial controllers within the
.Xr wscons 4
framework.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports a number of different key mappings which
can be chosen from with the kernel option
.Dq LKKBD_LAYOUT
at compile time or with the utility
.Xr wsconsctl 8
(variable:
.Dq keyboard.encoding )
at runtime.
Other mappings can be used if the whole keymap is replaced by means of
.Xr wsconsctl 8 .
The built-in mappings are at this time:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.\" .It KB_BE
.\" (
.\" .Dq be
.\" ) Belgium French.
.\" .It KB_CF
.\" (
.\" .Dq cf
.\" ) Canadian French.
.It KB_DE
.Pq de
German with
.Dq dead accents .
.\" .It KB_DK

.\" .It KB_ES

.\" .It KB_UK
.\" (

.It KB_US
.Pq us
English/US keyboard mapping (default).
.El
.Pp
.\" The KB_DE, KB_DK, KB_NO, KB_SF, KB_SG and KB_SV mappings can be used in
The KB_DE mapping can be used in
the KB_NODEAD
.Pq .nodead
variant.
This switches off the
.Dq dead accents .
.Sh EXAMPLES
To set a French keyboard layout, use
.Ic wsconsctl -w keyboard.encoding=fr .
To set it at kernel build time, add
the following to the kernel configuration file:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
option LKKBD_LAYOUT="KB_FR"
.Ed

.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr qsc 4 ,
.Xr wscons 4 ,
.Xr wskbd 4 ,
.Xr wsconsctl 8
.Sh CAVEATS
The LK-201 keyboard does not have a
.Dq Meta
or
.Dq Alt
key.
For convenience,
.Ox
handles the
.Dq Compose
key as an
.Dq Alt
key, unless the
.Dq Shift
key is pressed as well.
.Pp
LK-401 keyboards have two
.Dq Alt
keys and two
.Dq Compose
keys, and do not exhibit this particular behaviour.
