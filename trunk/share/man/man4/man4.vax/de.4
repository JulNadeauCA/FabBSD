.Sh NAME
.Nm de
.Nd DEC DEUNA/DELUA Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "de0 at uba? csr 0174510"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to a 10 Mb/s Ethernet network through
a Digital Equipment
.Tn UNIBUS
Network Adapter
.Pq Tn DEUNA .
.Pp
The interface normally tries to use a
.Dq trailer
encapsulation
to minimize copying data on input and output.
The use of trailers is negotiated with
.Tn ARP .
This negotiation may be disabled, on a per-interface basis,
by setting the
.Dv IFF_NOTRAILERS
flag with an
.Dv SIOCSIFFLAGS
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: hardware address %s.
This is a normal autoconfiguration message noting the 6 byte physical
Ethernet address of the adapter.
.Pp
.It de%d: oerror, flags=%b tdrerr=%b.
The hardware indicated an error
in transmitting a packet to the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.Pp
.It de%d: ierror, flags=%b lenerr=%b (len=%d).
The hardware indicated an error
in reading a packet from the cable.
The status and error flags are reported.
.Pp
.It de%d: buffer unavailable.
The interface received more packets
than it had buffers allocated to receive them.
.El
.Pp
The following messages indicate a probable hardware error performing
the indicated operation during autoconfiguration or initialization.
The two control and status registers
should indicate the nature of the failure.
See the hardware manual for details.
.Bl -diag
.It de%d: reset failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: ppcb failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: read addr failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtring failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
.It de%d: wtmode failed, csr0=%b csr1=%b.
