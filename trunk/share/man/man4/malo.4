.Sh NAME
.Nm malo
.Nd Marvell Libertas IEEE 802.11b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "malo* at cardbus?"
.Cd "malo* at pci?"
.Cd "malo* at pcmcia?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Marvell Libertas 88W8335/88W8310/88W8385 based
PCI/CardBus/PCMCIA network adapters.
The second generation 88W8335/88W8310 chipsets support 802.11b/g.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.\" .It IBSS mode
.\" Also known as
.\" .Em IEEE ad-hoc
.\" mode or
.\" .Em peer-to-peer
.\" mode.
.\" This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
.\" Stations associate with a service set.
.\" However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.\" .It Host AP
.\" In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
.\" for other cards.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs a set of firmware files which are loaded when
an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/malo8335-h
.It Pa /etc/firmware/malo8335-m
.It Pa /etc/firmware/malo8338
.It Pa /etc/firmware/malo8385-h
.It Pa /etc/firmware/malo8385-m
.El
.Pp
These firmware files are not free because Marvell refuses
to grant distribution rights.
As a result, even though FabBSD includes the driver, the firmware files cannot
be included and users have to download these files on their own.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware, designed to be used with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
can be found at:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
http://www.nazgul.ch/malo/malo-firmware-1.4.tgz
.Ed
.Sh HARDWARE
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:
.Pp
.Bl -column -compact "Microcom Travelcard" "MALO111" "CardBus" "a/b/g" -offset 6n
.Em "Card	Chip	Bus	Standard"
Ambicom WL54CF	88W8385	PCMCIA	b/g
I-O DATA WN-G54/CF	88W8385	PCMCIA	b/g
Netgear WG511v2	88W8310	CardBus	b/g
Netgear WG311v3	88W8335	PCI	b/g
Tenda TWL541C	88W8310	CardBus	b/g
Tenda TWL542P	88W8335	PCI	b/g
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures malo0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
.\"The following
.\".Xr hostname.if 5
.\"example creates a host-based access point on boot:
.\".Bd -literal -offset indent
.\"inet 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0 NONE media autoselect \e
.\"	mediaopt hostap nwid my_net chan 11
.\".Ed
.\".Pp
Configure malo0 to join network
.Dq my_net
using WPA-PSK with passphrase
.Dq my_passphrase :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig malo0 nwid my_net wpa wpapsk \e
	$(wpa-psk my_net my_passphrase)
.Ed
.Pp
Return malo0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig malo0 -bssid -chan media autoselect \e
	nwid "" -nwkey -wpa -wpapsk
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig malo0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
