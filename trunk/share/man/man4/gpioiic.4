.Sh NAME
.Nm gpioiic
.Nd GPIO I2C controller
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gpioiic* at gpio? offset 0 mask 0x3"
.Cd "iic* at gpioiic?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver allows bit-banging an I2C bus as a master using two GPIO pins.
The first pin is used as a serial data (SDA) signal and the second as
a serial clock (SCL).
Both GPIO pins must be able to drive an output and the SDA pin must be
also able to read an input.
.Pp
The pins are specified in the kernel configuration with the
.Ar offset
and the
.Ar mask
locators.
Each bit in the
.Ar mask
locator defines one pin; the pin number is calculated as an addition of
the bit position and the
.Ar offset
locator.
For example,
.Ar offset 17
and
.Ar mask 0x5
defines pin numbers 17 and 19.
