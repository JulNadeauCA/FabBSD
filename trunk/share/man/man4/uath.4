.Sh NAME
.Nm uath
.Nd Atheros USB IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uath* at uhub? port ?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports USB 2.0 wireless network devices based on Atheros
Communications fifth generation AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets.
.Pp
The AR5005UG chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband processor
and an AR2112 Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate between 2300 and 2500 MHz
(802.11b/g).
.Pp
The AR5005UX chipset is made of an AR5523 multiprotocol MAC/baseband processor
and an AR5112 dual band Radio-on-a-Chip that can operate between 2300 and
2500 MHz (802.11b/g) or 4900 and 5850 MHz (802.11a).
.Pp
The AR5005UG and AR5005UX chipsets both have an integrated 32-bit MIPS
R4000-class processor that runs a firmware and manages, among other things,
the automatic control of the transmit rate and the calibration of the radio.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
supports hardware WEP.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) is the de facto encryption standard
for wireless networks.
It can be typically configured in one of three modes:
no encryption; 40-bit encryption; or 104-bit encryption.
Unfortunately, due to serious weaknesses in WEP protocol
it is strongly recommended that it not be used as the
sole mechanism to secure wireless communication.
WEP is not enabled by default.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The following firmware file is loaded when a device is plugged:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/uath-ar5523
.El
.Pp
This firmware file is not freely redistributable.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures uath0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
Configure uath0 for WEP, using hex key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig uath0 nwkey 0x1deadbeef1
.Ed
.Pp
Return uath0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig uath0 -bssid -chan media autoselect \e
        nwid "" -nwkey
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig uath0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "uath%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "uath%d: could not load firmware (error=%s)"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the firmware to the onboard
MIPS R4000 processor.
.It "uath%d: could not initialize adapter (error=%d)"
The firmware was uploaded successfully but did not initialize properly or
in time.
.It "uath%d: could not send command (error=%s)"
An attempt to send a command to the firmware failed.
.It "uath%d: timeout waiting for command reply"
A read command was sent to the firmware but the firmware failed to reply in
time.
.It "uath%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
