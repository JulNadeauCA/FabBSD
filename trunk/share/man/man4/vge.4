.Sh NAME
.Nm vge
.Nd VIA Networking Technologies VT6122 PCI 10/100/Gigabit Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "vge* at pci?"
.Cd "ciphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for various NICs and embedded Ethernet interfaces
based on the VIA Networking Technologies VT6122 Gigabit Ethernet
controller chips, including the following:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
VIA Networking LAN-on-motherboard Gigabit Ethernet
.It
ZyXEL GN650-T 64-bit PCI Gigabit Ethernet NIC (ZX1701)
.It
ZyXEL GN670-T 32-bit PCI Gigabit Ethernet NIC (ZX1702)
.El
.Pp
The VT6122 is a 33/66Mhz 64-bit PCI device which combines a tri-speed
MAC with an integrated 10/100/1000 copper PHY.
(Some older cards use an external PHY.)
The MAC supports IPv4 transmit/receive IP/TCP/UDP hardware
checksum offload, VLAN tag insertion and stripping, a 64-entry CAM
filter and a 64-entry VLAN filter, 64-bit multicast hash filter,
4 separate transmit DMA queues, flow control
and Jumbo frames up to 16K in size.
The VT6122 has a 16K receive FIFO and 48K transmit FIFO.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver takes advantage of the VT6122's checksum offload and the CAM
filter support.
The CAM filter is used for multicast address filtering to provide
64 perfect multicast address filter support.
If it is necessary for the interface to join more than 64 multicast
groups, the driver will switch over to using the hash filter.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media types:
.Bl -tag -width 10baseTXUTP
.It Cm autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options.
The user can manually override the autoselected mode by adding media
options to the appropriate
.Xr hostname.if 5
file.
.It Cm 10baseT/UTP
Set 10Mbps operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 100baseTX
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation.
The
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Ic mediaopt
option can also be used to select either
.Cm full-duplex
or
.Cm half-duplex
modes.
.It Cm 1000baseT
Set 1000baseT operation over twisted pair.
Both
.Cm full-duplex
and
.Cm half-duplex
modes are supported.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options:
.Bl -tag -width full-duplex
.It Cm full-duplex
Force full duplex operation.
.It Cm half-duplex
Force half duplex operation.
.El
.Pp
