.Sh NAME
.Nm ifb
.Nd inextricable frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ifb* at pci?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at ifb?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver attempts to support various frame buffer cards based on the
3DLabs
.Sq Wildcat
chips, such as the
Sun
Expert3D
and
XVR-500
boards.
It does not provide direct device driver entry points
but makes its functions available via the internal
.Xr wsdisplay 4
interface.
.Sh DISPLAY RESOLUTION
If the
.Nm
frame buffer is used as the console display, a different resolution than
the default 1152x900 can be selected by changing the OpenPROM environment.
To change the default resolution, type the following:
.Pp
.Em \   ok
setenv
.Em output-device
screen:r1280x1024x76
.Pp
to change to a 76Hz 1280x1024 resolution.

frame buffer accepts the following resolutions:
