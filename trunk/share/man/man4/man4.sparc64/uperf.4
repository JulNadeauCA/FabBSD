.Sh NAME
.Nm uperf
.Nd performance counters driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "uperf* at ebus?"
.Cd "uperf* at sbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Some UltraSPARC host bridges provide performance counters on their host
bridges.
The counters are a part of the system controller chip (usc, dsc, or qsc).
On PCI machines the system controller shows up as a device on the EBus, but
on SBus machines the system controller exists in SBus space.
The
.Nm
driver provides access to these counters via
.Xr ioctl 2 .
.Sh IOCTLS
All of the ioctl calls supported by the
.Nm
driver take the following structure as an argument:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
struct uperf_io {
	int cnt_flags;
	int cnt_src0;
	int cnt_src1;
	u_int32_t cnt_val0;
	u_int32_t cnt_val1;
};
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_flags
field specifies which counters are being operated on and is a bit mask
of
.Fa UPERF_CNT0
and/or
.Fa UPERF_CNT1 .
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_src0
and
.Fa cnt_src1
fields specify the source for the counter.
Not all counters support monitoring all sources and specifying an invalid
source for a counter to monitor will result in an error.
The sources are specified below:

.El
.Pp
The
.Fa cnt_val0
and
.Fa cnt_val1
contain the values fetched for the counters.
Software using this interface should be prepared to handle the counters
rolling over.
.Pp
The
.Nm
device responds to the following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls, which are defined in
.Aq Pa dev/sun/uperfio.h .
.Bl -tag -width UPIO_GCNTSRC
.It Dv UPIO_GCNTSRC
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Retrieve the source the counters are monitoring.
The
.Fa cnt_flags
is a bit mask for which of the counters is to be fetched.
The result is returned in
.Fa cnt_src0
and/or
.Fa cnt_src1 .
.It Dv UPIO_SCNTSRC
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Set the source the counters should monitor.
This call also clears the current value of the counters that are set.
The
.Fa cnt_flags
is a bit mask for which of the counters is to be set.
The
.Fa cnt_src0
and/or
.Fa cnt_src1
fields specify the source to be set for the respective counter.
.It Dv UPIO_CLRCNT
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Clear the counters specified in
.Fa cnt_flags .
.It Dv UPIO_GETCNT
.Pq Li "struct uperf_io"
Retrieve the value for the counters specified in
.Fa cnt_flags .
The values are returned in
.Fa cnt_val0
and/or
.Fa cnt_val1 .
