.Sh NAME
.Nm noct
.Nd NetOctave NSP2000 crypto accelerator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "noct* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports cards based on the
.Tn NetOctave
.Tn NSP2000
packet processor.
The
.Tn NSP2000
contains a public key processor, random number generator, and
packet processor.
The random number generator provides random bits to the
.Xr random 4
subsystem.
.Pp
Currently, the packet processor registers with the
.Xr crypto 9
subsystem only to support MD5, SHA1, DES-CBC, and Triple-DES for
.Xr ipsec 4
and
.Xr crypto 4 .
The public key engine is not yet supported.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr crypt 3 ,
.Xr crypto 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr ipsec 4 ,
.Xr pci 4 ,
.Xr random 4 ,
.Xr crypto 9
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 3.2 .
