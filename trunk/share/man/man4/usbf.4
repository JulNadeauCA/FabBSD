.Sh NAME
.Nm usbf
.Nd introduction to Universal Serial Bus function support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.\" XXX SYNOPSIS should be similar to usb.4
.Cd "cdcef* at usbf?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
FabBSD provides machine-independent bus support and drivers for Universal
Serial Bus
.Pq Tn USB
functions, making it possible in principle for machines running FabBSD to act
as
.Tn USB
device to a
.Tn USB
host.
.Pp
The FabBSD
.Nm
driver has three layers: the controller, the logical device, and the
function layer.
The controller attaches to a physical bus.
The logical device attaches to the controller and the function attaches
to the logical device.
.Pp
Function drivers implement the characteristics of a particular
.Tn USB
device class that the
.Tn USB
host will see when the device is connected to the bus.
.Pp
.\" See
.\" .Xr usbf 9
.\" for a description of the kernel programming interfaces for
.\" .Tn USB
.\" function support.
.Sh SUPPORTED FUNCTIONS
FabBSD includes the following machine-independent
.Tn USB
function drivers, sorted by device type and driver name:
