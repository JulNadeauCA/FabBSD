.Sh NAME
.Nm art ,
.Nm musycc
.Nd Accoom Networks Artery T1/E1 Network driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "musycc* at pci?"
.Cd "art* at musycc?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Accoom Networks Artery Series Network
cards.
This includes the following models:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
Accoom Artery Single T1/E1 PCI
.It
Accoom Artery Dual T1/E1 PCI
.El
.Pp
The following media types (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "media E1-G.704-CRC4" -offset 3n -compact
.It Cm media No T1
Set T1, B8ZS ESF operation.
.It Cm media No T1-AMI
Set T1, AMI SF operation.
.It Cm media No E1
Set E1, HDB3, G.703 clearchannel operation.
.It Cm media No E1-G.704
Set E1, HDB3, G.704 structured operation without CRC4 checksum.
.It Cm media No E1-G.704-CRC4
Set E1, HDB3, G.704 structured operation with CRC4 checksum.
.El
.Pp
If no media type is set, the
.Nm
driver places the card into E1-G.704-CRC4 mode.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver supports the following media options for all available media types:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width "mediaopt ppp" -offset 3n -compact
.It Cm mediaopt No ppp
Use PPP line protocol.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are set,
the card defaults to cHDLC (Cisco High-Level Data Link Control) with 32-bit
HDLC CRC checksum.
.Pp
It is possible to change the timeslot range for the following media types:
.Pp
.Bl -item -offset indent -compact
.It
T1
.It
T1-AMI
.It
E1-G.704
.It
E1-G.704-CRC4
.El
.Pp
If no timeslots are configured, the
.Nm
driver configures the card to use all possible channels.
Use
.Xr ifconfig 8
to change the timeslot range.
For example:
.Pp
Enable all possible channels for this card:
.Dl # ifconfig art0 timeslot all
.Pp
Enable channels 1-31 for this card:
.Dl # ifconfig art0 timeslot 1-31
.Pp
Enable channels 1-15, 16-31 for this card:
.Dl # ifconfig art0 timeslot 1-15,16-31
.Pp
It is possible to change the clock mode of the interface with
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
To use the internal clock as clock source for the line, use
.Em master
mode.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig art0 media E1-G.704 mode master
.Pp
The default mode recovers the clock from the incoming line signal.
This can be explicitly set by using the
.Em autoselect
mode.
For example:
.Pp
.Dl # ifconfig art0 media E1-G.704 mode autoselect
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "art%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network
.It "art%d: internal FIFO underflow"
The internal FIFO got empty while transmitting a packet.
This may indicate a PCI bus congestion.
.It "art%d: internal FIFO overflow"
The internal FIFO overflowed while receiving a packet.
This may indicate a PCI bus congestion.
.It "art%d: Failed to malloc memory"
There are not enough mbufs available for allocation.
