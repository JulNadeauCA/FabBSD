.Sh HISTORY
In
.Ox 3.0
and earlier, this driver was named
.Nm bt
but was renamed to
.Nm bha
in later releases.
.Sh BUGS
The
.Tn Buslogic
BT-930 is not supported in this driver.
.Pp
The
.Tn Buslogic
BT-445S has a problem in early hardware and firmware revisions
which prevents proper operation on a system with more than 16MB of RAM.
Hardware revision D and firmware revision 3.37 should be considered minimum
requirements for using this board on systems configured in this manner.
