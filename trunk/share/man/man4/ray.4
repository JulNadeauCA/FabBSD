.Sh NAME
.Nm ray
.Nd Raytheon Raylink/WebGear Aviator IEEE 802.11FH wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ray* at pcmcia?"
.Cd "option RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_DEFAULT=RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_USA"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver supports the Raytheon Raylink and Aviator 2.4/PRO
802.11 Frequency Hopping 2Mbps wireless PCMCIA cards.
.Pp
The device uses IEEE 802.11 standard Frequency Hopping Spread Spectrum
signaling and operates in the ranges of 2.400 to 2.4835 Gigahertz.
This frequency range is further restricted by country according to
that country's regulations.
Currently the
.Nm
driver defaults to using the ranges appropriate for the USA.
To change this setting, define the kernel option
.Dv RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_DEFAULT
to one of the following values:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_USA
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_EUROPE
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_JAPAN
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_KOREA
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_SPAIN
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_FRANCE
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_ISRAEL
RAY_PID_COUNTRY_CODE_AUSTRALIA
.Ed
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver include:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Raytheon Raylink WLAN
.It WebGear Aviator 2.4
.It WebGear Aviator PRO
.El
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures ray0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
Return ray0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig ray0 -bssid -chan media autoselect nwid ""
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig ray0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ray0: card failed self test: status x"
Indicates the card has failed its initial startup tests.
.El

.Xr ifmedia 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr netintro 4 ,
.Xr pcmcia 4 ,
.Xr hostname.if 5 ,
.Xr ifconfig 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device driver first appeared in
.Nx 1.5 .
.Ox
support was added in
.Ox 2.7 .
.Sh AUTHORS
.An -nosplit
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Christian E. Hopps Aq chopps@netbsd.org
and ported to
.Ox
by
.An Michael Shalayeff Aq mickey@openbsd.org .
.Sh BUGS
Currently the infrastructure mode is untested, and authentication
using WEP is unimplemented.
.Pp
Firmware version 4 does not interop with version 5 or higher.
