.Sh NAME
.Nm presto
.Nd Prestoserve battery-backed memory
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "presto* at sbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn Legato
Prestoserve NVRAM cards
used to be part of the
.Dq NFS accelerator
product, which used the cards memory as an NFS-dedicated cache, increasing
performance of NFS servers exporting filesystem as NFS protocol, version 2.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not attempt to achieve such a behaviour, which is questionable
with the advent of NFS protocol, version 3.
.Pp
Instead, it will provide direct access to the NVRAM, as a block device.
