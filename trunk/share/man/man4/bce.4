.Sh NAME
.Nm bce
.Nd Broadcom BCM4401 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "bce* at pci?"
.Cd "bmtphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides support for the Broadcom BCM4401 10/100 Ethernet card.
.Pp
The following media types and options (as given to
.Xr ifconfig 8 )
are supported:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Cm media No autoselect
Enable autoselection of the media type and options (default).
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force full-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 100baseTX Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 100Mbps (Fast Ethernet) operation and force half-duplex mode.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No full-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force full-duplex.
.It Cm media No 10baseT Cm mediaopt No half-duplex
Set 10Mbps operation and force half-duplex.
.El
.Pp
If no media options are present, the
.Nm
driver places the card into autoselect mode.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "bce%d: failed to enable memory mapping!"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to find mem space"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to wake up from power state D%d"
The card has lost its configuration data during power save mode.
.It "bce%d: couldn't map interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: couldn't establish interrupt"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to alloc space for ring descriptors, error = %d"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to map DMA buffers, error = %d"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to create ring DMA map, error = %d"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to create tx DMA map, error = %d"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: unable to create rx DMA map, error = %d"
A fatal initialization error has occurred.
.It "bce%d: Tx packet consumes too many DMA segments, dropping..."
An outgoing packet didn't fit in the allocated number of segments.
.It "bce%d: unable to load Tx buffer, error = %d"
Short on resources when transmitting a packet, it will be retried later.
.It "bce%d: device timeout"
The device has stopped responding to the network or there is a problem
with the network connection (cable).
.It "bce%d: transmit fifo underflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: receive fifo overflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: receive descriptor underflow"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: descriptor protocol error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: data error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: descriptor error"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: general purpose timeout"
An error occurred, the interface will be reinitialized.
.It "bce%d: unable to allocate or map rx(%d) mbuf, error = %d"
Failed to initialize the interface.
.It "bce%d: timed out writing pkt filter ctl"
Failed to add MAC address.
.It "bce%d: timed out disabling ethernet mac"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: receive dma did not go idle after error"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: timed out resetting ethernet mac"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: while resetting core, reject did not set"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: while resetting core, busy did not clear"
A problem occurred when resetting the interface.
.It "bce%d: PHY read timed out reading phy %d, reg %d, val = %x"
An error occurred when reading a PHY register on the MII.
.It "bce%d: PHY read timed out writing phy %d, reg %d, val = %x"
