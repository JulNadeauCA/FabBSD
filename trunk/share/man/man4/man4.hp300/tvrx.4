.Sh NAME
.Nm tvrx
.Nd HP98705 TurboVRX
.Dq TigerShark
frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "tvrx*      at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at tvrx?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The TurboVRX frame buffer is an accelerated, high resolution
.Pq 1280x1024
external display, connected to a 98702 DIO-II interface board.
Models 98705A and 98705C are 8-bit color frame buffers, while model
98705B is 16-bit color with a 16-bit Z-buffer.
All models also have four overlay planes.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
Currently, the driver can only use one overlay plane, and will run as an
unaccelerated monochrome frame buffer.
.Pp
The TurboVRX cards can be configured using the 5 DIP switches selector on
the interface board to define the
.Dq select code .
The select code value is computed by adding 133 to the number made from the
five binary digits.
The default settings, with the two MSB switches set to 1 and the three LSB
switches set to 0, provide a select code of 157.
