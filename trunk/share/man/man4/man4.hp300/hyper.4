Hyperion frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hyper*     at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at hyper?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Hyperion is a monochrome, high-resolution frame buffer.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Sh SELECT CODE
The
.Dq select code
for the Hyperion card can be set with the JP01 and JP02 jumpers.
These jumpers are located in the upper right corner of the board, when it is
placed component side up, with the video connector to the left.
Numbering the jumper pins from 1 to 3 from left to right,
the following combinations are available:
.Bl -column "JP02" "JP01" -offset indent
.It Sy "JP02" Ta Sy "JP01" Ta Sy "Select code"
.It " "
.It Li "1-2" Ta "1-2" Ta 135
.It Li "1-2" Ta "2-3" Ta 134
.It Li "2-3" Ta "1-2" Ta "133 (factory settings)"
.It Li "2-3" Ta "2-3" Ta 132
.El
.Pp
Leaving a jumper open is equivalent to shorting pins 1 and 2.
