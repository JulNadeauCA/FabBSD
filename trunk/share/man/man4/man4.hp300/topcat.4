.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
HP98543, HP98544, HP98545A and HP98547A Topcat,
as well as the
HP98548A, HP98549A and HP98550A Catseye
and the
A1416A Kathmandu
are accelerated frame buffers, with the following resolution and color depth:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width A1416A -offset indent -compact
.It 98543
512x400 4-bit color Topcat
.It 98544
1024x768 monochrome Topcat
.It 98545A
1024x768 4-bit color Topcat
.It 98547A
1024x768 6-bit color Topcat
.It 98548A
1280x1024 monochrome Catseye
.It 98549A

.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
The Topcat display cards are not user configurable.
If one is present on a
system, it will always have a frame buffer address of 0x200000 and a control
register address of 0x560000.
.Pp
The Catseye and Kathmandu cards can be configured using the on-board 8 DIP
switches selector to define the
.Dq select code .
A select code of 1 will use the same settings as the Topcat cards.
