.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm apci
.Nd Apollo utility chip serial communications interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "apci* at frodo?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports the non-keyboard 8250-like UART connected to the
.Xr frodo 4
Apollo utility chip.
The first UART is used to communicate with the Domain keyboard.
The second is the serial console port when the firmware is in Domain/OS
mode, and is mapped to select code 9 by the HP-UX firmware (except
on 425e models).
As such, the second UART is handled by the
.Xr dca 4
driver on all models but the 425e.
.Pp
There is no tty attached to the first UART as it lacks modem/flow
control and is directly connected to the keyboard connector.
.Pp
Input and output for each line may be set to one of the following baud rates:
50, 75, 110, 134.5, 150, 300, 600, 1200, 1800, 2400, 4800, 9600,
19200, or 38400.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It apci%d: silo overflow.
The single-character input
.Dq silo
has overflowed and incoming data has been lost.

.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr dnkbd 4 ,
.Xr frodo 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr tty 4
.Sh BUGS
Much of the code in the
.Nm
driver could be shared with the
.Xr dca 4
driver.
