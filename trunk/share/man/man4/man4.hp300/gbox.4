.Dt GBOX 4 hp300
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm gbox
.Nd
.Tn HP98700
Gatorbox frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "gbox*      at intio?"
.Cd "gbox*      at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at gbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn HP98700
and
.Tn HP98710
are 4-bit color frame buffers,
also known as the Gatorbox.
They can be extended to 8-bit color with an
.Tn HP98701
frame buffer extension.
The 98710 also has some acceleration features.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
The 98700 can be used as the only graphics device on a system, in which case
it will be used as the system console.
It can also be installed as a secondary display device.
For the first case, the
.Tn HP98287A M.A.D.
interface card
should be set to internal control space.
This will put the frame buffer at the DIO address 0x200000 and the control
registers at 0x560000.
For use as a secondary device,
the 98287A should be set to frame buffer address 0x300000,
and to an external select code.
.Pp
It should be noted that this configuration will conflict with the 98547
display card which has a 2 megabyte frame buffer starting at address 0x200000.
The 98700 should only be installed as a secondary device in a machine with a
1 bit 98544 display card or 4 bit 98545 card.
The
.%T 98700H Installation Guide
contains further configuration information.
