.Sh NAME
.Nm ppi
.Nd
.Tn HP-IB
printer/plotter interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ppi0 at hpibbus0 slave 5 punit 0"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm ppi
interface provides a means of communication with
.Tn HP-IB
printers and plotters.
.Pp
Special files
.Pa ppi0
through
.Pa ppi3
are used to access the devices, with the digit at the end
of the filename referring to the bus address of the device.
Current versions of the autoconf code can not probe for these
devices, so the device entry in the configuration file must be
fully qualified.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/ppi[0-3] -compact
.It Pa /dev/ppi[0-3]
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr hpibbus 4 ,
.Xr intro 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver is very primitive, it handshakes data out byte by byte.
It should use
.Tn DMA
whenever possible.
