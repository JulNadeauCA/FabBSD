.Nm rbox

.Tn HP98720
Renaissance frame buffer
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "rbox*      at intio?"
.Cd "rbox*      at dio?"
.Cd "wsdisplay* at rbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Tn HP98720
and
.Tn HP98721
are stackable 4-bit color frame buffers,
also known as the Renaissance.
By adding up to 7
.Tn HP98722A
frame buffer extensions, it is possible to add overlay planes.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver provides a frame buffer abstraction to the
.Xr wscons 4
console framework.
.Pp
The Renaissance can be configured at either the ``internal'' address
(frame buffer address 0x200000, control register space address 0x560000)
or at an external select code less than 32.
The hardware installation manual describes the procedure for
setting these values.

.Xr intro 4 ,

.Xr wsdisplay 4
.Sh BUGS
This driver has not been tested with all possible
combinations of frame buffer boards and scan boards installed in the device.
