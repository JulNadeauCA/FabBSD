.Tn CS/80
disk interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hd* at hpibbus?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This is a generic
.Tn CS/80
disk driver.
Only a small number of possible
.Tn CS/80
drives are supported,
but others can easily be added by adding tables to the driver.
.Sh DISK SUPPORT
The driver interrogates the controller
to determine the type of drive attached.
The driver recognizes the following drives:
7912, 7914, 7933, 7936, 7937, 7945,
.Tn 757A/B ,
.Tn 7958A/B ,
.Tn 7959B ,
7962, 7963, 9122, 9134, 7912, 7936,
and 9122,
not all of which have been tested.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /dev/rhd[0-7][a-p] -compact
.It Pa /dev/hd[0-7][a-p]
block files
.It Pa /dev/rhd[0-7][a-p]
raw files
.El
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "hd%d err: v%d u%d, R0x%x F0x%x A0x%x I0x%x, block %d"
An unrecoverable data error occurred during transfer of the
specified block on the specified disk.

.Sh BUGS
.Tn CS/80
drives have 256 byte sectors which are mapped to 512 byte
``sectors'' by the driver.
Since some
.Tn CS/80
drives have an odd number of sectors per cylinder,
the disk geometry used is not always accurate.
.Pp
A program to analyze the logged error information (even in its
present reduced form) is needed.
