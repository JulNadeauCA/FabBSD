.Sh NAME
.Nm wpi
.Nd Intel PRO/Wireless 3945ABG IEEE 802.11a/b/g wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "wpi* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for
.Tn Intel
PRO/Wireless 3945ABG Mini PCI Express network adapters.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and decryption
of data frames.
.Pp
The device has one temperature sensor.
Its value is in the range from 0 (coolest) to 285 (warmest).
Sensor data is updated every 500 milliseconds.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The driver needs at least version 2.14.1.5 of the following firmware file,
which is loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It Pa /etc/firmware/wpi-3945abg
.El
.Pp
This firmware file is not free because Intel refuses to grant
distribution rights without contractual obligations.
As a result, even though FabBSD includes the driver, the firmware file cannot
be included and users have to download this file on their own.
The official person to state your views to about this issue is
majid.awad@intel.com.
.Pp
A prepackaged version of the firmware, designed to be used with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
can be found at:
.Bd -literal
http://damien.bergamini.free.fr/packages/openbsd/wpi-firmware-2.14.1.5.tgz
.Ed
.Sh EXAMPLES
The following
.Xr hostname.if 5
example configures wpi0 to join whatever network is available on boot,
using WEP key
.Dq 0x1deadbeef1 ,
channel 11, obtaining an IP address using DHCP:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
dhcp NONE NONE NONE nwkey 0x1deadbeef1 chan 11
.Ed
.Pp
Configure wpi0 to join network
.Dq my_net
using WPA-PSK with passphrase
.Dq my_passphrase :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wpi0 nwid my_net wpa wpapsk \e
	$(wpa-psk my_net my_passphrase)
.Ed
.Pp
Return wpi0 to its default settings:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wpi0 -bssid -chan media autoselect \e
	nwid "" -nwkey -wpa -wpapsk
.Ed
.Pp
Join an existing BSS network,
.Dq my_net :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig wpi0 192.168.1.1 netmask 0xffffff00 nwid my_net
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wpi%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "wpi%d: fatal firmware error"
For some reason, the firmware crashed.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.
.It "wpi%d: Radio transmitter is off"
The radio transmitter is off and thus no packet can go out.
The driver will reset the hardware.
Make sure the laptop radio switch is on.
.It "wpi%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "wpi%d: firmware file too short: %d bytes"
The firmware image is corrupted and can't be loaded into the adapter.
.It "wpi%d: could not load firmware"
An attempt to load the firmware into the adapter failed.
The driver will reset the hardware.
