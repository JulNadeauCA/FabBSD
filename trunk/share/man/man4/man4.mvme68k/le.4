.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10 Mb/s Ethernet network via the
.Tn AMD
7990
.Tn LANCE
Ethernet chip set.
.Sh HARDWARE
The
.Nm
interface supports the following mvme68k hardware:
.Bl -tag -width "onboard" -offset indent
.It Em onboard
MVME147 onboard Ethernet interface
.It Em MVME376
MVME376 VMEbus Ethernet card
.El
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
For MVME376, the card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through three sets of DIP switches,
.Dq SW1
and
.Dq SW2 ,
located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
VME connectors, and
.Dq SW3 ,
closer to the AM7990DC chip at the bottom edge.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff"
.It Li SW1 Ta SW2 Ta SW3 Ta Address
.It " "
.It Li "UUU_UU_U" Ta "U__U____" Ta "______U_" Ta "0xffff1200"
