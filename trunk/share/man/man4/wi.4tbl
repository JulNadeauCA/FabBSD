.Sh NAME
.Nm wi
.Nd "WaveLAN/IEEE, PRISM 2-3, and Spectrum24 IEEE 802.11b wireless network device"
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "# all architectures"
.Cd "wi* at pci?"
.Cd "wi* at pcmcia? function ?"
.Cd "wi* at uhub? port ?"
.Pp
.Cd "# macppc extra attachment"
.Cd "wi* at macobio?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for wireless network adapters based around
the Lucent Hermes, Intersil PRISM-2, Intersil PRISM-2.5, Intersil PRISM-3,
and Symbol Spectrum24 chipsets.
All five chipsets provide a similar interface to the driver.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver encapsulates all IP and ARP traffic as 802.11 frames, though
it can receive either 802.11 or 802.3 frames.
Transmit speed is selectable between 1Mbps fixed, 2Mbps fixed, 2Mbps
with auto fallback, 5.5Mbps, 8Mbps, or 11Mbps, depending on hardware.
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer
as in ad-hoc mode.
Cards with very old firmware revisions do not support this mode.
.It IBSS master
Also know as
.Em Host IBSS
mode.
In this mode the station takes on part of the role of an access point,
though traffic does not pass through it to reach the other stations.
When a group of stations are operating in IBSS mode, one of them must be
the master, specifying the network name of the service set.
.It Host AP
In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
for other cards.
Only cards based on the Intersil chipsets support this mode.
Furthermore, this mode is not supported on USB devices.
.It ad-hoc mode
More accurately known as
.Em ad-hoc demo mode .
This mode does not require an access point; the adapter communicates with
other ad-hoc stations within range on a peer-to-peer basis.
This mode is not specified by the IEEE 802.11 standard and there
may be problems interoperating with adapters manufactured by different vendors.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use both software and hardware
Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP).
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Silver and Gold cards as well as the Intersil
and Symbol cards have support for WEP encryption.
The WaveLAN Gold as well as newer Intersil and Symbol cards support
104-bit keys, the others only accept 40-bit keys.
The Lucent WaveLAN/IEEE Bronze cards do not support WEP at all.
See also
.Sx CAVEATS
below.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh HARDWARE
Cards supported by the
.Nm
driver come in a variety of packages, though the most common
are of the PCMCIA type.
In many cases, the PCI version of a wireless card is simply
a PCMCIA card bundled with a PCI adapter.
The PCI adapters come in two flavors: true PCMCIA bridges and
dumb PCMCIA bridges.
A true PCMCIA bridge (such as those sold by Lucent) will attach
as a real PCMCIA controller.
The wireless card will then attach to the PCMCIA bus.
Wireless cards in PCMCIA slots may be inserted and ejected on the fly.
A dumb bridge, on the other hand, does not show up as a true PCMCIA bus.
The wireless card will simply appear to the host as a normal PCI
device and will not require any PCMCIA support.
Cards in this type of adapter should only be removed when the
machine is powered down.
.Pp
The following cards are among those supported by the
.Nm
driver:

.Pp
Note that some of the PRISM-II adapters only work at 3.3V, hence
.Xr cardbus 4
support is required for those cards to set VCC correctly, even
though they are really 16-bit cards.
.Pp
USB support is still experimental and the device may stop functioning
during normal use.
Resetting the device by configuring the interface down and back up again will
normally reactivate it.
.Pp
Several vendors sell PCI adapters built around the PLX Technology 9050

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "wi%d: init failed"
The WaveLAN card failed to come ready after an initialization command
was issued.
.It "wi%d: failed to allocate %d bytes on NIC"
The driver was unable to allocate memory for transmit frames in the
NIC's on-board RAM.
.It "wi%d: device timeout"
The WaveLAN failed to generate an interrupt to acknowledge a transmit
command.

.Ox

.Ox 2.6 .
.Sh AUTHORS

.Sh CAVEATS
The original Lucent WaveLAN cards usually default to channel 3;
newer cards use channel 10 by default.
Non-Lucent cards vary, for instance the Addtron cards use channel
11 by default.
See
.Xr ifconfig 8
for information on how to change the channel.
.Pp
Not all 3.3V
.Nm
PCMCIA cards work.
.Pp
IBSS creation does not currently work with Symbol cards.
.Pp
The host-based access point mode on the Intersil PRISM cards has
bugs when used with firmware versions prior to 0.8.3 and is completely
unusable with firmware versions prior to 0.8.0 and 1.4.0-1.4.2.
.Pp
Software WEP is currently only supported in Host AP and BSS modes.
Furthermore, software WEP is currently incapable of decrypting
fragmented frames.
Lucent-based cards using firmware 8.10 and above fragment encrypted
frames sent at 11Mbps.
To work around this, Lucent clients with this firmware revision
connecting to a Host AP server should use a 2Mbps connection or
upgrade their firmware to version 8.72.
.Pp
Host AP mode doesn't support WDS or power saving.
Clients attempting to use power saving mode may experience
significant packet loss
(disabling power saving on the client will fix this).
.Pp
Support for USB devices is buggy.
Host AP mode and AP scanning are not currently supported with USB devices.
