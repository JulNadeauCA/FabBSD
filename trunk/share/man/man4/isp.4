.Sh NAME
.Nm isp
.Nd QLogic based SCSI or Fibre Channel SCSI interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "isp* at pci?     " Pq PCI
.Cd "isp* at sbus?    " Pq SBus
.Cd "scsibus* at isp? "
.Cd "option ISP_COMPILE_FW"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This driver provides access to a
.Tn SCSI
bus or a Fibre Channel
connected to
.Tn QLogic
ISP1000 (SBus), ISP1020 (PCI), ISP1040 (PCI), ISP1080 (PCI), ISP12160 (PCI)
.Tn SCSI
host adapters or ISP2100 (PCI), ISP2200 (PCI) Fibre Channel
or ISP2300 (PCI) 2-Gigabit Fibre Channel host adapters.
.Pp
Features include support for UltraSCSI and wide mode transactions for
.Tn SCSI ,
and Ultra2 LVD (for the ISP1080) and Ultra3 LVD (for the ISP12160)
and the FCP SCSI (private loop, public loop or fabric) for Fibre Channel.
Command tagging is supported for all (in fact, Fibre Channel requires tagging).
.Sh CONFIGURATION
Adding
.Tn option ISP_COMPILE_FW
to the kernel configuration file ensures that known good firmware
will be downloaded to the driver at attach time.
This is the default setting on sparc, sparc64 and macppc platforms,
and is also recommended on platforms where the card's bios may not be
initialized upon power-up.
