.Nd MVME376 AMD LANCE Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "le0 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1200 ipl 1"
.Cd "le1 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1400 ipl 1"
.Cd "le2 at vmes0 addr 0xffff1600 ipl 1"

.Cd "le4 at vmes0 addr 0xffff5600 ipl 1"
.Cd "le5 at vmes0 addr 0xffffa400 ipl 1"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the AMD 7990/LANCE-based Interphase 4207
.Sq Hawk ,
also sold as Motorola MVME376,
VME boards.
This in turn provides an interface to the
.Tn Ethernet
network.
.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through three sets of DIP switches,
.Dq SW1
and
.Dq SW2 ,
located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
VME connectors, and
.Dq SW3 ,
closer to the AM7990DC chip at the bottom edge.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
