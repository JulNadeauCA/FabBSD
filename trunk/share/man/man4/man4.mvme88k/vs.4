.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
provides access to the Interphase 4210
.Sq Jaguar ,
4220 and 4220W
.Sq Cougar ,
also sold as the Motorola MVME328, MVME328S and MVME328XT
VME boards.
Depending on the version, these boards provide up to two
single-ended or differential, narrow or wide SCSI interfaces.
Dual-channel boards do not necessarily have channels of the same type.
On
.Sq Jaguar
boards, the
.Nm
driver cannot report whether a channel is single-ended or differential.
It is recommended to be very careful if the type of the channel is not
known with certitude.

boards.

.Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
The card's base address
.Po
matching the
.Em addr
locator on the configuration line
.Pc
is defined through a set of jumpers on the card.
.Ss MVME328, MVME328S and Interphase 4210 jumper configuration
The card address is controlled with nine jumpers, labeled
.Dq JB1
on the board, near the fuse in a corner of the card.
They are contiguous to the
.Dq JA7
single jumper and
.Dq JA8
dual jumper, located immediately to the left of the
.Dq JB1
block.
.Pp
The only supported configurations are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
.It Li JB1 Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It Li "___X_XX__" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_____XX__" Ta "0xffff9800" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "____XX_X_" Ta "0xffff4800" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "_____X_X_" Ta "0xffff5800" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "___X___X_" Ta "0xffff7000" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_______X_" Ta "0xffff7800" Ta "6th board"
.El
.Ss MVME328XT and Interphase 4220 and 4220W jumper configuration
The card address is controlled with two sets of eleven jumpers \(en
which label will depend on the card model and artwork revision.
These jumpers are located between the two VME P1 and P2 connectors.
With the card oriented so that the VME connectors are at the bottom,
the bottom row of eleven jumpers should have the leftmost jumper set
and the ten rightmost jumpers open.
.Pp
The only supported configurations for the top row are:
.Bl -column "xxxxxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff" -offset indent
.It Li Jumpers Ta Address Ta Configuration
.It Li "___X_XX____" Ta "0xffff9000" Ta "1st board"
.It Li "_____XX____" Ta "0xffff9800" Ta "2nd board"
.It Li "____XX_X___" Ta "0xffff4800" Ta "3rd board"
.It Li "_____X_X___" Ta "0xffff5800" Ta "4th board"
.It Li "___X___X___" Ta "0xffff7000" Ta "5th board"
.It Li "_______X___" Ta "0xffff7800" Ta "6th board"

The daughterboard providing access to the second SCSI channel does not
work under
.Ox
if the first SCSI channel is empty.
