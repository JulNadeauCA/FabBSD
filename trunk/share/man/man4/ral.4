.Sh NAME
.Nm ral
.Nd Ralink Technology IEEE 802.11a/b/g/Draft-N wireless network device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ral* at cardbus?"
.Cd "ral* at pci?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver supports PCI/PCIe/CardBus wireless adapters based on the Ralink RT2500,
RT2501, RT2600, RT2700 and RT2800 chipsets.
.Pp
The RT2500 chipset is the first generation of 802.11b/g adapters from Ralink.
It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2560 MAC/BBP and an RT2525 radio
transceiver.
.Pp
The RT2501 chipset is the second generation of 802.11a/b/g adapters from
Ralink.
It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2561 MAC/BBP and an RT2527 radio
transceiver.
This chipset provides support for the IEEE 802.11e standard with multiple
hardware transmission queues and allows scatter/gather for efficient DMA
operations.
.Pp
The RT2600 chipset consists of two integrated chips, an RT2661 MAC/BBP and an
RT2529 radio transceiver.
This chipset uses the MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) technology with
multiple radio transceivers to extend the operating range of the adapter and
to achieve higher throughput.
However, the RT2600 chipset does not support any of the 802.11n features.
.Pp
The RT2700 chipset is a low-cost version of the RT2800 chipset.
It supports a single transmit path and two receiver paths (1T2R).
It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2760 or RT2790 (PCIe) MAC/BBP and
an RT2720 (2.4GHz) or RT2750 (2.4GHz/5GHz) radio transceiver.
.Pp
The RT2800 chipset is the first generation of 802.11n adapters from Ralink.
It consists of two integrated chips, an RT2860 or RT2890 (PCIe) MAC/BBP and
an RT2820 (2.4GHz) or RT2850 (2.4GHz/5GHz) radio transceiver.
The RT2800 chipset supports two transmit paths and up to three receiver
paths (2T2R/2T3R).
It can achieve speeds up to 144Mbps (20MHz bandwidth) and 300Mbps (40MHz
bandwidth.)
.Pp
These are the modes the
.Nm
driver can operate in:
.Bl -tag -width "IBSS-masterXX"
.It BSS mode
Also known as
.Em infrastructure
mode, this is used when associating with an access point, through
which all traffic passes.
This mode is the default.
.It IBSS mode
Also known as
.Em IEEE ad-hoc
mode or
.Em peer-to-peer
mode.
This is the standardized method of operating without an access point.
Stations associate with a service set.
However, actual connections between stations are peer-to-peer.
.It Host AP
In this mode the driver acts as an access point (base station)
for other cards.
.It monitor mode
In this mode the driver is able to receive packets without
associating with an access point.
This disables the internal receive filter and enables the card to
capture packets from networks which it wouldn't normally have access to,
or to scan for access points.
.El
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured to use
Wireless Equivalent Privacy (WEP) or
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA-PSK and WPA2-PSK).
WPA is the de facto encryption standard for wireless networks.
It is strongly recommended that WEP
not be used as the sole mechanism
to secure wireless communication,
due to serious weaknesses in it.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver relies on the software 802.11 stack for both encryption and
decryption of data frames on the RT2500, RT2501 and RT2600 chipsets.
On the RT2700 and RT2800 chipsets, the
.Nm
driver offloads both encryption and decryption of data frames to the
hardware for the WEP40, WEP104, TKIP(+MIC) and CCMP ciphers.
.Pp
The transmit speed is user-selectable or can be adapted automatically by the
driver depending on the number of hardware transmission retries.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver can be configured at runtime with
.Xr ifconfig 8
or on boot with
.Xr hostname.if 5 .
.Sh FILES
The RT2501, RT2600, RT2700 and RT2800 chipsets require the following firmware
files to be loaded when an interface is brought up:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -offset indent -compact
.It /etc/firmware/ral-rt2561
.It /etc/firmware/ral-rt2561s
.It /etc/firmware/ral-rt2661
.It /etc/firmware/ral-rt2860
.El
.Pp
The RT2500 chipset does not require a firmware to operate.

.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
.Bl -diag
.It "ral%d: error %d, could not read firmware %s"
For some reason, the driver was unable to read the firmware image from the
filesystem.
The file might be missing or corrupted.
.It "ral%d: could not load 8051 microcode"
An error occurred while attempting to upload the microcode to the onboard 8051
microcontroller unit.
.It "ral%d: timeout waiting for MCU to initialize"
The onboard 8051 microcontroller unit failed to initialize in time.
.It "ral%d: device timeout"
A frame dispatched to the hardware for transmission did not complete in time.
The driver will reset the hardware.
This should not happen.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
driver first appeared in
.Ox 3.7 .
Support for the RT2501 and RT2600 chipsets was added in
.Ox 3.9 .
Support for the RT2800 chipset was added in
.Ox 4.3 .
Support for the RT2700 chipset was added in
.Ox 4.4 .
.Sh AUTHORS
The
.Nm
driver was written by
.An Damien Bergamini Aq damien@openbsd.org .
.Sh CAVEATS
The
.Nm
driver does not make use of the hardware cryptographic engine present on
the RT2500, RT2501 and RT2600 chipsets.
.Pp
The
.Nm
driver does not support any of the 802.11n capabilities offered by
the RT2700 and RT2800 chipsets.
Additional work is required in
.Xr ieee80211 9
before those features can be supported.
.Pp
Some PCI
.Nm
adapters seem to strictly require a system supporting PCI 2.2 or greater and
will likely not work in systems based on older revisions of the PCI
specification.
Check the board's PCI version before purchasing the card.
