.Sh NAME
.Nm crypto
.Nd hardware crypto access driver
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm "pseudo-device crypto" Op Ar count
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides userland applications access to hardware crypto support
via the kernel.
The
.Pa /dev/crypto
device node primarily operates in an
.Xr ioctl 2
based model, permitting a variety of applications to query device capabilities,
submit transactions, and get results.
.Pp
If
.Ar count
is given in the specification, and is greater than 0, a maximum of one
.Nm crypto
device is created.
.Pp
The following
.Xr ioctl 2
calls apply only to the
.Nm crypto
devices:
.Bl -tag -width CIOCGSESSION
.It Dv CIOCGSESSION
Set up a new crypto session for a new type of operation.
.It Dv CIOCFSESSION
Free a previously established session.
.It Dv CIOCCRYPT
Perform a crypto operation against a previously set up session.
.El
.Sh FEATURES
Depending on hardware being present, the following symmetric and
asymmetric cryptographic features are potentially available from
.Pa /dev/crypto :
