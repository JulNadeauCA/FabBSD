.Sh NAME
.Nm gif
.Nd generic tunnel interface
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "pseudo-device gif"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface is a generic tunnelling pseudo-device for IPv4 and IPv6.
It can tunnel IPv[46] traffic over IPv[46], for a total of four
possible combinations.
The behavior of
.Nm
is mainly based on RFC 1933 IPv6-over-IPv4 configured tunnel.
.Pp
A
.Nm
interface can be created at runtime using the
.Ic ifconfig gif Ns Ar N Ic create
command or by setting up a
.Xr hostname.if 5
configuration file for
.Xr netstart 8 .
.Pp
To use
.Nm gif ,
the administrator needs to configure the addresses used for the outer header.
This can be done by using
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
or through the
.Dv SIOCSIFPHYADDR
ioctl.
The administrator needs to also configure the addresses used for the
inner header, by using
.Xr ifconfig 8 .
Note that IPv6 link-local address
.Pq those start with Li fe80::
will be automatically configured whenever possible.
One may need to remove any IPv6 link-local address manually using
.Xr ifconfig 8 ,
to disable the use of IPv6 as inner header
.Pq e.g., when a pure IPv4-over-IPv6 tunnel is required .
Also, the routing table may be used to route the packets toward the
.Nm
interface.
.Pp
If plain Ethernet-over-IP is being used,
the
.Xr sysctl 3
variable
.Dv net.inet.etherip.allow
must be set to 1.
This is not necessary in cases where Ethernet-over-IP is being
protected using
.Xr ipsec 4 .

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
device first appeared in WIDE hydrangea IPv6 kit.
.\"
.Sh BUGS
There are many tunnelling protocol specifications,
defined differently from each other.
.Nm
may not interoperate with peers which are based on different specifications,
and are picky about outer header fields.
For example, you cannot usually use
.Nm
to talk with IPsec devices that use IPsec tunnel mode.
.Pp
The current code does not check if the ingress address
.Pq outer source address
configured to
.Nm
makes sense.
Make sure to configure an address which belongs to your node.
Otherwise, your node will not be able to receive packets from the peer,
and your node will generate packets with a spoofed source address.
.Pp
If the outer protocol is IPv6, path MTU discovery for encapsulated packet
may affect communication over the interface.
.Pp
If more than one
.Nm
interface is configured with the same pair of outer addresses, the
one with the lowest index number will receive all traffic.
