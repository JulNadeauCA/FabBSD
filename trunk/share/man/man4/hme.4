.Sh NAME
.Nm hme
.Nd Sun Happy Meal 10/100 Ethernet device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "hme* at pci?"
.Cd "hme* at sbus?"
.Cd "luphy* at mii?"
.Cd "nsphy* at mii?"
.Cd "qsphy* at mii?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
interface provides access to the 10Mb/s and 100Mb/s Ethernet networks via the
.Tn National
DP83840
Ethernet 10/100 Mb/s Physical Layer
or the
.Tn Quality
QS6612
Ethernet MII Transceiver for Category 5 Twisted Pair Cable
chip sets.
The
.Nm
is found on the SunSwift and Sun QuadFastEthernet boards.
.Pp
When a
.Nm
interface is brought up, by default, it will attempt to auto-negotiate the
link speed and duplex.
The speeds, in order of attempt, are:
100 Mb/s Full Duplex, 100 Mb/s Half Duplex, 10 Mb/s Full Duplex, and
10 Mb/s Half Duplex.
.Pp
The
.Nm
supports several media types, which are selected via the
.Xr ifconfig 8
command.
The supported media types are:
.Bl -tag -width "media autoselect" -offset indent
.It media autoselect
Attempt to autoselect the media type (default)
.It media 100baseTX mediaopt full-duplex
Use 100baseTX, full duplex
.It media 100baseTX
Use 100baseTX, half duplex
.It media 10baseT mediaopt full-duplex
Use 10baseT, full duplex
.It media 10baseT
Use 10baseT, half duplex
