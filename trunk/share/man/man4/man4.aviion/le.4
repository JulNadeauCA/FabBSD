.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides access to the on-board AMD 7990/LANCE interface,
as well as the VME Interphase 3207 Hawk Ethernet boards.
This in turn provides an interface to the
.Tn Ethernet
network.

.\" .Sh HARDWARE CONFIGURATION
.\" The card's base address
.\" .Po
.\" matching the
.\" .Em addr
.\" locator on the configuration line
.\" .Pc
.\" is defined through three sets of DIP switches,
.\" .Dq SW1
.\" and
.\" .Dq SW2 ,
.\" located in the middle of the board, near the space between the two
.\" VME connectors, and
.\" .Dq SW3 ,
.\" closer to the AM7990DC chip at the bottom edge.
.\" .Pp
.\" The only supported configurations are:
.\" .Bl -column "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "xxxxxxxx" "0xffffffff"
