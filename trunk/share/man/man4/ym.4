.Sh NAME
.Nm ym
.Nd Yamaha OPL3-SAx audio device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "ym* at isapnp?"
.Cd "midi* at ym?"
.Cd "audio* at ym?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
driver provides support for Yamaha OPL3-SAx chipset-based cards.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr audio 4 ,
.Xr intro 4 ,
.Xr isapnp 4 ,
.Xr midi 4 ,
.Xr wss 4
.Sh HISTORY
This driver is a thin wrapper around the
.Xr wss 4
driver.
The
.Nm
device driver appeared in
.Ox 2.4 .
.Sh BUGS
The "FM" DAC, wavetable synth, and MIDI port are not supported.
I can't seem to access any of the extended registers so
master volume, mute, 3-d control might not work through the mixer interface.
Lots of work needed.
