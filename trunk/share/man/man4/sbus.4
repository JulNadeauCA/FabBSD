.Sh NAME
.Nm sbus
.Nd introduction to SBus bus support
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Cd "sbus* at mainbus?"
.Cd "sbus* at iommu?"
.Cd "sbus* at xbox?"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
These
.Nm
attachments are specific to the sparc and sparc64 ports.
.Pp
.Nm
is an I/O interconnect bus mostly found in
.Tn SPARC
workstations and small to medium server class systems.
It supports both on-board peripherals and extension boards.
The
.Nm
specifications define the bus protocol as well as the electrical and
mechanical properties of the extension slots.
.Pp
FabBSD provides support for the following devices.
