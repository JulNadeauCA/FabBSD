.Sh NAME
.Nm dopowerhooks
.Nd run all power hooks
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/systm.h>
.Ft void
.Fn dopowerhooks "int why"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn dopowerhooks
function invokes all power hooks established using the
.Xr powerhook_establish 9
function.
At
.Dq suspend
and
.Dq standby
time, power hooks are called in reverse order, i.e.,
the power hook established last will be called first.
At
.Dq resume
time, power hooks are called in order, i.e., the power hook
established first will be called first.
.Pp
This routine is called from the
.Xr apm 4
driver when a power change is detected.
The
.Fa why
argument is one of
.Dv PWR_SUSPEND ,
.Dv PWR_STANDBY ,
or
.Dv PWR_RESUME ,
describing the reason for the change in power state.
Each established power hook is passed this information so the appropriate
actions can be taken.
