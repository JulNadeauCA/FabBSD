.Dt MALLOC 9
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm malloc
.Nd kernel memory allocator
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Fd #include <sys/types.h>
.Fd #include <sys/malloc.h>
.Ft void *
.Fn malloc "unsigned long size" "int type" "int flags"
.Fn MALLOC "space" "cast" "unsigned long size" "int type" "int flags"
.Ft void
.Fn free "void *addr" "int type"
.Fn FREE "void *addr" "int type"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn malloc
function allocates uninitialized memory in kernel address space for an
object whose size is specified by
.Fa size .
.Fn free
releases memory at address
.Fa addr
that was previously allocated by
.Fn malloc
for re-use.
The
.Fn MALLOC
macro variant is functionally equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
(space) = (cast)malloc((u_long)(size), type, flags)
.Ed
.Pp
and the
.Fn FREE
macro variant is equivalent to
.Bd -literal -offset indent
free((caddr_t)(addr), type)
.Ed
.Pp
These macros should only be used when the
.Fa size
argument is a constant.
.Pp
Unlike its standard C library counterpart
.Pq Xr malloc 3 ,
the kernel version takes two more arguments.
The
.Fa flags
argument further qualifies
.Fn malloc Ns 's
operational characteristics as follows:
.Bl -tag -width xxx -offset indent
.It Dv M_WAITOK
This is defined to be 0, and is therefore most useful as an aid to code
readability.
In effect, it is the same as having no other
.Fa flags
specified.
If memory is currently unavailable,
.Fn malloc
may call sleep to wait for resources to be released by other processes.
.It Dv M_NOWAIT
Causes
.Fn malloc
to return
.Dv NULL
if the request cannot be immediately fulfilled due to resource shortage.
.It Dv M_CANFAIL
In the
.Dv M_WAITOK
case, if not enough memory is available, return
.Dv NULL
instead of calling
.Xr panic 9 .
.Dv M_CANFAIL
has no effect if
.Dv M_NOWAIT
is specified.
.It Dv M_ZERO
Causes
.Fn malloc
to return zeroed memory.
.El
.Pp
The
.Fa type
argument broadly identifies the kernel subsystem for which the allocated
memory was needed, and is commonly used to maintain statistics about
kernel memory usage.

Statistics based on the
.Fa type
argument are maintained only if the kernel option
.Dv KMEMSTATS
is used when compiling the kernel
.Po the default in current\ \&
FabBSD kernels
.Pc
and can be examined by using
.Sq vmstat -m .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
.Fn malloc
returns a kernel virtual address that is suitably aligned for storage of
any type of object.
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
A kernel compiled with the
.Dv DIAGNOSTIC
configuration option attempts to detect memory corruption caused by
such things as writing outside the allocated area and unbalanced calls to the
.Fn malloc
and
.Fn free
functions.
Failing consistency checks will cause a panic or a system console message:
.Bl -bullet -offset indent -compact
.Pp
.It
panic:
.Dq malloc - bogus type
.It
panic:
.Dq malloc: out of space in kmem_map
.It
panic:
.Dq malloc: allocation too large
.It
panic:
.Dq malloc: wrong bucket
.It
panic:
.Dq malloc: lost data
.It
panic:
.Dq free: unaligned addr
.It
panic:
.Dq free: duplicated free
.It
panic:
.Dq free: multiple frees
.It
panic:
.Dq kmeminit: minbucket too small/struct freelist too big
.It
.Dq multiply freed item Aq addr
.It
.Dq Data modified on freelist: Aq data object description
.El
.Sh DEBUGGING
A kernel compiled with the
.Cm MALLOC_DEBUG
option allows for more extensive debugging of memory allocations.
The
.Va debug_malloc_type ,
.Va debug_malloc_size ,
.Va debug_malloc_size_lo
and
.Va debug_malloc_size_hi
variables choose which allocation to debug.
.Va debug_malloc_type
should be set to the memory type and
.Va debug_malloc_size
should be set to the memory size to debug.
0 can be used as a wildcard.
.Va debug_malloc_size_lo
and
.Va debug_malloc_size_hi
can be used to specify a range of sizes if the exact size to debug is not
known.
When those are used,
.Va debug_malloc_size
needs to be set to the wildcard.
.Dv M_DEBUG
can also be specified as an allocation type to force allocation with
debugging.
.Pp
Every call to
.Fn malloc
with a memory type and size that matches the debugged type and size will
allocate two virtual pages.
The pointer returned will be aligned so that
the requested area will end at the page boundary and the second virtual page
will be left unmapped.
This way we can catch reads and writes outside the allocated area.
.Pp
Every call to
.Fn free
with memory that was returned by the debugging malloc will cause the memory
area to become unmapped so that we can catch dangling reads and writes to
freed memory.
.Pp
There are no special diagnostics if any errors are caught by the debugging
malloc.
The errors will look like normal access to unmapped memory.
On a memory access error, the
.Ic show malloc
command in
.Xr ddb 4
can be invoked to see what memory areas are allocated and freed.
If the faulting address is within two pages from an address on the allocated
list, there was an access outside the allocated area.
If the faulting address is within two pages from an address on the free list,
there was an access to freed memory.
.Pp
Care needs to be taken when using the
.Cm MALLOC_DEBUG
option:  the memory consumption can run away pretty quickly and there is
a severe performance degradation when allocating and freeing debugged memory
types.
