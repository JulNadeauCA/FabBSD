.Dt RC.CONF 8
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm rc.conf ,
.Nm rc.conf.local
.Nd system daemon configuration database
.Sh DESCRIPTION
This file contains a series of Bourne-shell syntax assignments
that are used to configure the system daemons.
It is not read by the kernel, but is sourced by various other files
in the
.Pa /etc/rc.*
series in order to set shell variables used therein
to control the behaviour of the scripts.
.Pp
It is advisable to leave the
.Pa /etc/rc.conf
file untouched, and instead create and edit a new
.Pa /etc/rc.conf.local
file.
Variables set in this file will override variables previously set in
.Pa /etc/rc.conf .
.Pp
There are three sections in this file.
The first is used to turn features on or off.
For example, whether the system runs the
.Xr machctld 8
daemon is determined by the line in this section
.Bd -literal -offset indent
machctld_flags=NO		# for normal use: ""
.Ed
.Pp
If this line is edited to contain some valid machctld daemon command-line
flags, such as
.Bd -literal -offset indent
machctld_flags="-b localhost"
.Ed
.Pp
then the machctl daemon will be started with those options.
.Pp
The second section contains some other programs that can either be run or not,
but that don't need options.
They can be set to YES or NO.
For example, the line
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nfs_server=NO
.Ed
.Pp
prevents the NFS server daemons from starting.
To run NFS, just change this line's value from NO to YES,
.Sy and
also make whatever changes are needed for the server
to have something to do (set up the
.Xr exports 5
file etc.).
.Pp
The third section contains values that parameterize servers started by
one of the first two sections, and are ignored if the corresponding
server is not running.
For example, if
.Nm nfs_server ,
is enabled, then the line
.Bd -literal -offset indent
nfsd_flags="-tun 4"
.Ed
.Pp
provides command-line arguments for the NFS server.
.Pp
This particular line instructs
.Xr nfsd 8
to start four copies of the server.
On a busy file server, 8 (or more) copies are recommended.

file first appeared in
