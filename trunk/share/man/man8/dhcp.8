.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm dhcp
.Nd configuring FabBSD for DHCP
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) allows hosts on a TCP/IP network
to configure one or more network interfaces based on information collected from
a DHCP server in response to a DHCP request.
This mechanism is often used, for example, by cable modem and DSL network
providers to simplify network configurations for their clients/customers.
.Pp
Information typically contained within a DHCP response includes an IP
address for the interface, subnet mask, broadcast address, router (gateway)
listing, domain name server listing, and the interface's MTU.
.Pp
To set up FabBSD as a DHCP client:
.Bl -enum -offset indent
.It
For each interface that is to be configured via DHCP, create a
.Pa /etc/hostname.XXX
file (where XXX is the interface's identifier, e.g., ep1) that starts with
the word
.Dq dhcp ,
optionally followed by additional interface options.
See
.Xr hostname.if 5
for more information on the format of these files.
.Pp
The
.Pa /etc/netstart
script reads each of these hostname files at boot-time and runs the
.Xr dhclient 8
program for each interface that is to be configured via DHCP.
.It
[Optional] To tweak settings, edit
.Pa /etc/dhclient.conf .
This file is shipped with the system.
See
.Xr dhclient.conf 5
and
.Xr dhclient 8
for details.
