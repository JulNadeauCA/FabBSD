.Dt COORDINATES 7
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm coordinates
.Nd standard FabBSD coordinate format
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Various commands such as
.Xr move 1
accept arguments describing real-valued coordinates in a given number of
dimensions:
.Pp
    "x,y"        # Coordinate in 2 dimensions
    "x,y,z,w"    # Coordinate in 4 dimensions
.Pp
The coordinates may be separated by ":", "," or spaces.
Since coordinates are often specified on the command-line, the minus ("-")
sign may be substituted for "m":
.Pp
    "-10:-20"
    "m10:m20"    # Equivalent to -10:-20
.Pp
Units may be specified along with the coordinates:
.Pp
    "0.75in:0.50in"
    "10mm,20mm"
    "10,20mm"       # Equivalent to 10mm,20mm
    "10,20"         # Use default ($UNITS environment variable)
.Pp
When no units are specified with any of the coordinates, the environment
variable
.Dv UNITS
is used (see
.Xr environ 7 ) .
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
manual page first appeared in FabBSD 1.0.
