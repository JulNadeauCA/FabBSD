.It /altroot/
Alternate (backup) location for the root
.Pq Sq /
filesystem
(see
.Xr daily 8 ) .
.It /bin/
User utilities fundamental to both single and multi-user environments.
These programs are statically compiled and therefore do not depend on any
system libraries to run.
.It /bsd
Pure kernel executable
(the operating system loaded into memory at boot-time).
.It /bsd.mp
Pure kernel executable
for multi-processor machines.
.It /bsd.rd
Installation kernel.
The built-in RAM disk contains utilities which can be run
without an external file system, so this kernel is useful
for limited system maintenance too.
.It /dev/
Block and character device files.
.Pp

emulation is in effect (see

.Xr compat_hpux 8 ,
.Xr compat_ibcs2 8 ,
.Xr compat_linux 8 ,
.Xr compat_osf1 8 ,
.Xr compat_sunos 8 ,

Empty directory commonly used by
system administrators as a temporary mount point.
.It /root/
Default home directory for the superuser.

System programs and administration utilities
fundamental to both single and multi-user environments.
These programs are statically compiled and therefore do not depend on any
system libraries to run.
