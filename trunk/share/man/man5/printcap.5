.Sh NAME
.Nm printcap
.Nd printer capability database
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm printcap
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
file is a simplified version of the
.Xr termcap 5
database used to describe line printers.
The spooling system accesses the
.Nm
file every time it is used, allowing dynamic addition and deletion of printers.
Each entry in the database is used to describe one printer.
This database may not be substituted for, as is possible for
.Xr termcap 5 ,
because it may allow accounting to be bypassed.
.Pp
The default printer is normally
.Dq lp ,
though the environment variable
.Ev PRINTER
may be used to override this.
Each spooling utility supports an option,
.Fl P Ns Ar printer ,
to allow explicit naming of a destination printer.
.Pp
Refer to the
.%T "4.3 BSD Line Printer Spooler Manual"
for a complete discussion on how to set up the database for a given printer.
.Sh CAPABILITIES
Refer to
.Xr termcap 5
for a description of the file layout.

If the local line printer driver supports indentation, the daemon
must understand how to invoke it.
.Sh FILTERS
If a printer is specified via
.Sy lp
(either local or remote),
the
.Xr lpd 8
daemon creates a pipeline of
.Dq filters
to process files for various printer types.
The pipeline is not set up for remote printers specified via
.Sy rm
unless the local host is the same as the remote printer host given.
The filters selected depend on the flags passed to
.Xr lpr 1 .
The pipeline set up is:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
p	pr | if	regular text + pr(1)
none	if	regular text
c	cf	cifplot
d	df	DVI (tex)
g	gf	plot(3)
n	nf	ditroff
f	rf	Fortran
t	tf	troff
v	vf	raster image
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Sy if
filter is invoked with arguments:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Sy if
.Op Fl c
.Fl w Ns Ar width
.Fl l Ns Ar length
.Fl i Ns Ar indent
.Fl n Ar login
.Fl h Ar host acct-file
.Ed
.Pp
The
.Fl c
flag is passed only if the
.Fl l
flag (pass control characters literally) is specified to
.Xr lpr 1 .
.Ar width
and
.Ar length
specify the page width and length
(from
.Sy pw
and
.Sy pl ,
respectively) in characters.
The
.Fl n
and
.Fl h
parameters specify the login name and host name of the owner
of the job, respectively.
The
.Ar acct-file
function is passed from the
.Sy af
.Nm
entry.
.Pp
If no
.Sy if
is specified,
.Sy of
is used instead, with the distinction that
.Sy of
is opened only once, while
.Sy if
is opened for every individual job.
Thus,
.Sy if
is better suited to performing accounting.
The
.Sy of
is only given the
.Ar width
and
.Ar length
flags.
.Pp
All other filters are called as:
.Bd -filled -offset indent
.Nm filter
.Fl x Ns Ar width
.Fl y Ns Ar length
.Fl n Ar login
.Fl h Ar host acct-file
.Ed
.Pp
where
.Ar width
and
.Ar length
are represented in pixels, specified by the
.Sy px
and
.Sy py
entries, respectively.
All filters take
.Em stdin
as the file,
.Em stdout
as the printer,
may log either to
.Em stderr
or using
.Xr syslog 3 ,
and must not ignore
.Dv SIGINT .
.Sh LOGGING
Error messages generated by the line printer programs themselves
are logged by
.Xr syslog 3
using the
.Dv LPR
facility.
Messages printed on
.Em stderr
by the filters are sent to the corresponding
.Sy lf
file.
The filters may, of course, use
.Xr syslog 3
themselves.
.Pp
Error messages sent to the console have a carriage return and a line
feed appended to them, rather than just a line feed.
