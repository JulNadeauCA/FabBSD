.Sh DESCRIPTION
Users may put a file named

in their home directory.
If this file exists,

(and sendmail-like mailers) will redirect mail for the user to the list of
addresses found in the
.Pa .forward
file.
.Pa .forward
files must not be group or world writable.
The user's home directory should not be group writable.
The
.Pa .forward
file must be owned by and readable by the indicated user.
.Pp
A
.Pa .forward
file contains one or more lines where each line is an e-mail address
or the name of a private incoming mailer where incoming mail will be
forwarded.

.Bd -literal -offset indent
# lines with # in the first column are ignored
# empty lines are ignored
# #@# with whitespace on both sides may be used to start a comment
