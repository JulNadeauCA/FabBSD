	* Added number variable Hss
	* Changed Hps1 and Hps2 to units

	  that is the argument to .INITR

Fri Sep 6 07:13:07 1996 Jörgen Hägg (jh at axis.se)

	* version 1.30
	* This is more like a beta-release, bugs might pop up. :-)
	* last line in TOC was not correctly terminated (missing .br)
	* changed the indentation for displays, it will now
	  indent to the current indent, not the one at the definition
	  of the display.
	* Equation marks should now work better, indentation also.
	* included these bug fixes from Larry Jones:
	*   The documentation for the argument to .AS was incorrect for MT 4.
	*   \*(EM should be a double-dash for nroff.
	*   \nS is in points, not units.
	*   If \nO isn't set, the default page offset should be .75i for nroff
		and .963i for troff.
	*   .S D should set the point size to \nS, not 10.
	*   .S was setting the vertical spacing based on the old point size
		instead of the new point size.
	*   Got rid of a spurrious .br that prevented run-in headings from
		working.
	*   Reset the .SP counters in pg@header so that spacing on one page
		won't affect spacing on subsequent pages.
	*   Allow .AU and .AF with no arguments (real mm does, even though it
		isn't documented).
	*   Do .init@reset first thing to initialize the default environment.
	*   For MT 4, the title should be 4 points larger than the default size,
		not 12 point.
	*   The cover environment needs to be initialized.
	*   Printing the abstract on the first page needs to be controlled by
		the .AS argument.
	*   Heading eject should be suppressed if the heading immediately
		follows the first page stuff (title, author, etc.).
	*   support for table of contents numbering style (.nr Oc)
	*   changes the troff empty line height from .25v to .5v
	*   fixed section page numbering
	*   fixed a really nasty bug in footnotes that could cause you
		to lose the page footer completely if the very first
		footnote on the page occurred at just the wrong place
