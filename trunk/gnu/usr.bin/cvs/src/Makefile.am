# some namespace hackery going on that maybe shouldn't be.  Long term fix is to
# try and remove naming ocnflicts and fix Automake to allow particular includes
# to be attached only to particular object files.  Short term fix is either or.

## MAINTAINER Targets

# version.c
# - build this here so that we can distribute it
# - version.c needs to be updated only once, since it depends on
#   configure.in, not on the results of a 'configure' run.
# - It is guaranteed (with GNU Make) that when the version in configure.in
#   is changed, acversion.m4 is built only after the new version number is
#   propagated to the Makefile.  (Libtool uses the same guarantee.)
# - need the explicit version.o dependency or else make won't match
#   $(srcdir)/version.c when looking for a dependency for version.c
