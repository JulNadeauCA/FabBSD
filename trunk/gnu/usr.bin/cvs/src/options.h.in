   to create a group with no users in it (except perhaps cvs

   all the repository files to that group, and change all directory
   permissions in the repository to 770.  The last person to modify a

   create a security hole!  You will receive no warning other than the
   fact that files in the working directory are owned by the group
   which cvs is setgid to).

   One security hole which has been reported is that setgid is not
   turned off when the editor is invoked--most editors provide a way
   to execute a shell, or the user can specify an editor (this one is
   large enough to drive a truck through).  Don't assume that the
