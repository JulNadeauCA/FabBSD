	* Makefile.am: New file needed by Automake
	* Makefile.in: Regenerated

2000-11-21  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* filesubr.c (check_statbuf): subtract 3600 from the times returned
	by the stat function when daylight savings time is in effect due to a
	bug in Windoze.  Fixes a bug where CVS thinks all files have been
	touched after a transition to or from daylight savings time.

2000-11-20  Derek Price  <derek.price@openavenue.com>

	* filesubr.c (cvs_temp_file): add this function to match the one in
	src/filesubr.c

2000-01-02  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@red-bean.com>

	* pwd.c (getlogin): try to find login name in environment
	variables before asking the operating system.

1999-02-26  Jim Kingdon  <http://www.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Make RELATIVE_REPOS the default, as in
	../src/options.h.in.
	Remove CVS_DIFFDATE; removed from CVS on 27 Jun 1996.

1998-10-13  Jim Kingdon

	* README: Update information about make/project files, cygwin and
	the (lack of) need for RCS 5.7.  Tweak a few more things.

1998-10-03  Jim Kingdon

	* win32.c: Include cvs.h and only check server_active if
	SERVER_SUPPORT is defined.

1998-10-02  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	(This was reported by someone else but I don't remember who).
	* config.h: Define SYSTEM_CLEANUP.
	* win32.c (wnt_cleanup): New function, implements it.

1998-09-28  Johannes Stezenbach <johannes.stezenbach@propack-data.de>
	    and Jim Kingdon

	* config.h (CVS_RENAME): Define.
	* filesubr.c, config.h (wnt_rename): New function.
	* filesubr.c (rename_file): Call CVS_RENAME not rename.

1998-09-04  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* win32.c (gethostname): Expand comment about gethostname
	vs. GetComputerName (reported by Randy Coulman).

1998-07-01  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* startserver.c (wnt_shutdown_server): Check for errors from close().

1998-06-30  Noel Cragg

    * startserver.c: add a global variable which notes if we've opened
	a socket.  Since the code in client.c will call wnt_shutdown_server
	regardless of which client method we've selected, we need to make
	sure and not call shutdown or closesocket on a pipe (it won't work).
	(wnt_shutdown_server): use the new global to decide whether or not
	to call socket routines or simply use close.
	

1998-06-11  Jim Kingdon

	* config.h (CVS_STAT, CVS_LSTAT): Define.
	* filesubr.c, config.h (wnt_stat, wnt_lstat, check_statbuf):

 	asked about the top-level directory.

Fri Jan 16 00:57:31 1998  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* sanity.sh: Remove.  As far as I know the Windows hacks in this
	file have been superceded by improvements to Cygwin and/or Ian's
	recent changes to src/sanity.sh.  The ones I noticed: we had been
	working around lack of /dev/null (apprently Cygwin now has it); we
	had been not expecting rm -rf to delete readonly files (apparently
	it now does); there was an issue with case of arguments passed on
	command line (it would seem like Cygwin has changed this).
	I also notice that the file had not even been in the distribution
	because it was missing from Makefile.in (ugh).

13 Jan 1998  Jim Kingdon

	* run.c (run_exec): Change parameters from char * to const char *.

Tue Jan 13 16:57:56 1998  Ian Lance Taylor  <ian@cygnus.com>

	* config.h (FOLD_FN_CHAR): Don't define; instead move to
	lib/system.h, where it is defined conditionally.
	(FILENAMES_CASE_INSENSITIVE, ISDIRSEP): Likewise.
	(WNT_filename_classes, fncmp, fnfold): Likewise for declarations.
	* filesubr.c (WNT_filename_classes): Remove; now in lib/fncase.c.

Fri Oct 31 16:52:30 1997  Abe Feldman

	* config.h: Define UTIME_EXPECTS_WRITABLE.

Tue Oct 28 14:50:37 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* run.c: Also define call_diff and call_diff3.

Sat Sep 13 20:13:09 1997    <Martin.Sjoelin@ubs.ch>
	indentation/whitespace fixes by Jim Kingdon

Thu Aug 28 12:06:37 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (link_file): Remove #if 0'd version; the real version
	is elsewhere in this file.

Sun Aug 10 21:08:12 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* ndir.c, ndir.h, pwd.c, pwd.h: Remove $Header; we decided to
	get rid of these some time ago.

	* README: Note KLUDGE_FOR_WNT_TESTSUITE when discussing tests.

Fri Jul 18 09:49:52 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Adjust discussion of makefiles to deal with Visual C++
	5.x.  One doesn't need patch if client and server are current.

10 Jul 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* config.h: Define USE_SETMODE_STDOUT.

8 Jul 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* rcmd.c (rcmd_authenticate): With error message, print the
	user names that we were attempting to use.
	* win32.c (win32getlogin): If GetUserName returns "", return
	NULL.

Sun, 22 Jun 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* win32.c: Also include winsock.h.
	Include stdlib.h (for exit()).
	* rcmd.c: Move include of cvs.h above test of HAVE_WINSOCK_H.

Tue Jun 17 16:35:06 1997  Jim Kingdon  (unknown@beezley)

	* rcmd.c: Check HAVE_WINSOCK_H in figuring out which files
	to include (see comment about making this portable).  If not
	HAVE_WINSOCK_H, make various #definitions.
	* rcmd.c (init_winsock): Move from here...
	* win32.c: ...to here.
	* rcmd.c (bind_and_connect, resolve_address): Shut up gcc -Wall
	(which doesn't know that error (1, ...) doesn't return).

Sun Jun  8 23:43:21 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h (HAVE_MKFIFO): Remove; not used anywhere.

Wed Apr  9 15:29:45 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): Add comments about "." and comparing
	NULL pointers.

8 Apr 1997  Jim Kingdon

	* rcmd.c: Instead of returning -1 and passing that back to
	startserver.c which will print a very vague error message, call
	error() right away with a specific message.  This also fixes
	some places where we had bogusly called GetLastError instead of
	WSAGetLastError.
	(init_winsock): Remove call to setsockopt.  It was an artifact
	from before the time that we defined NO_SOCKET_TO_FD, doesn't
	seem to be needed any more, and fails with some non-Microsoft
	winsock implementations.

Wed Apr  2 14:08:10 1997  Vince Del Vecchio  <vdelvecc@spd.analog.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon

	* sockerror.c: New file.
	* config.h (SOCK_STRERROR, SOCK_ERRNO): New macros.
	* startserver.c: In reporting errors from socket calls, use
 	SOCK_STRERROR and SOCK_ERRNO since strerror(errno) doesn't work
 	for Win32.
	* rcmd.c (rcmd_authenticate): Use WSASetLastError instead of
 	assigning to errno, since that is where the caller will look.

Sun Apr  6 17:22:19 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (copy_file): Add comment about CopyFile.

Wed Mar 26 13:13:41 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Also mention tar and gzip.

	* README: Binaries are now under 1.9, not 1.8.3, on
	ftp.cyclic.com.  Also mention http URL.

13 Mar 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (get_homedir): Allocate pathbuf; removes arbitrary
	limit.

Wed Mar 12 16:10:01 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (get_homedir): Expand comment about HOME

Thu Mar  6 19:46:53 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: tab stop setting apparently was under "Editor" in Visual
	C++ 2.x but it is under "Tabs" in Visual C++ 4.x.
	List number of warnings for regex.c (103, which is actually down
	from 121 prior to the change I just made to regex.c).

Sat Feb 15 15:27:39 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (dist-dir): Also handle SUBDIRS.

Tue Jan 28 18:29:03 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Remove SIZEOF_INT and SIZEOF_LONG; no longer needed
	with lib/md5.c changes.

1997-01-08  Jim Kingdon

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): If we just find a file (that
	is, without expanding a wildcard), return the file name
	as specified rather than as it exists in the filesystem.

Thu Jan  2 13:30:56 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c, ndir.c, ndir.h, pwd.c, pwd.h, run.c, stripslash.c:
	Remove "675" paragraph;	see ../ChangeLog for rationale.

Wed Jan  1 22:51:01 1997  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Reword comment for TMPDIR_DFLT to make it clear that
	this isn't specific to the pserver server.

Tue Dec 31 14:17:38 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Remove another mention of grep; CVS no longer uses it.

Tue Dec 31 11:01:29 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* README: Add note that the various support utilities can also be
 	found at the Cyclic FTP site; things move around on the net.

Tue Dec 31 12:33:29 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Add note about lack of need for rsh.  I don't know if
	this is the best place to talk about this, but many people get
	confused by it.

Sat Nov 30 15:33:22 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: Grep is no longer required.  Specify when gzip is required.

Tue Sep 10 19:20:25 1996  Mark A. Solinski  <markso@mcs.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	This is said to be the last set of changes needed for Win95:
	* rcmd.c: Include cvs.h.
	(rcmd_authenticate): Use send/recv instead of read/write.
	(rcmd): Don't call _open_osfhandle; just return the socket.
	* options.h: Move NO_SOCKET_TO_FD from here...
	* config.h: ...to here.  Update comment.
	* config.h (START_SERVER_RETURNS_SOCKET, SEND_NEVER_PARTIAL):
	Define.
	* startserver.c (shutdown_fd): Remove; it is unused.
	(wnt_start_server): Don't dup the file descriptor; instead set
	both *tofd and *fromfd to read_fd.
	(wnt_shutdown_server): Don't call _get_osfhandle; just use the
	argument as the socket.

Wed Sep  4 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (mkdir_if_needed): mkdir on NT only takes one,
	not two, arguments.

Thu Aug 29 09:47:33 1996  Mark A. Solinski  <markso@mcs.com>
			  and Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (deep_remove_dir, unlink_file_dir): ENOENT can also

	* filesubr.c (mkdir_if_needed): Added.

Thu Aug 22 19:12:17 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	The following changes are said to be necessary (but not
	sufficient) for Win95:
	* config.h (sleep): Use "unsigned int" not just "unsigned".
	* filesubr.c (deep_remove_dir): Treat EACCES as well as ENOTEMPTY
	as an indication that we need to remove the directory.

	* sanity.sh: include new tests from ../src/sanity.sh.

	* filesubr.c (copy_file): use open with O_CREAT instead of creat
 	so we can also use O_BINARY -- we don't want to do any LF -> CR/LF
 	translations when we copy files.

Fri May 17 11:53:13 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* README: In a few places it used to say "server" when it meant
	"client".  Fix it.  Say explicitly that there is no server on NT.
	Fix typos (4,0 -> 4.0; CVS.system -> CVS).

Thu May 16 16:52:45 1996  Noel Cragg  <noel@gargle.rain.org>

	* README: explain which utilities are required for client support

	* sanity.sh: Hacked version of src/sanity.sh for use under
 	CYGWIN32.

	* filesubr.c (expand_wild): Since FindFirstFile and FindNextFile
 	don't return the pathname of a file, we need to keep track of it
 	ourselves.

	* options.h: Fix defines for DIFF and GREP. 

	* run.c (run_exec): Flush stdout and stderr so we end up with the
 	correct interleaving of output for sanity.sh.  This can be removed
 	later, if desired.

Mon Mar 18 14:54:50 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* config.h: Don't declare gethostname; main.c already includes
	winsock.h.  Define FILENAMES_CASE_INSENSITIVE.

Fri Mar 15 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@cyclic.com>

	* filesubr.c (fncmp): Fix typo (n1 -> n2) which had caused the
	function to always return 0.

Thu Mar  7 08:55:39 1996  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	* run.c (run_popen): Changed more Popen() to run_popen()

Mon Feb 12 03:33:27 1996  Benjamin J. Lee  <benjamin@cyclic.com>

        * run.c: Changed Popen() to run_popen() for the benefit of
        case-insensitive linkers (VMS) which confuse Popen() with popen()

Fri Feb  9 22:10:12 1996  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* Makefile.in (distclean): Remove Makefile.

	than returning -1.

Thu Dec 21 16:00:00 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@peary.cyclic.com>

	* options.h: Don't define NO_SOCKET_TO_FD.

Mon Dec 18 09:57:29 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

Tue Dec 12 19:18:00 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * options.h (AUTH_CLIENT_SUPPORT, AUTH_SERVER_SUPPORT): these
        replace CVS_LOGIN.
        (RCSBIN_DFLT): expand comment.

Mon Dec 11 12:43:35 1995  adamg  <adamg@microsoft.com>

	* config.h: Add INITIALIZE_SOCKET_SUBSYSTEM macro to ensure that
	winsock is initialized early enough for the gethostname() in
	main.c to succeed.
	* rcmd.c: Remove from init_winsock(), and rcmd() code that
	initialized winsock on demand.

Thu Dec  7 14:49:16 1995  Jim Meyering  (meyering@comco.com)

	* filesubr.c (isaccessible): Rename from isaccessable.
	Update callers.

Mon Dec  4 10:46:31 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

	* The following change was copied from src/filesubr.c.  This is
	because we need filesubr.c to compile, not because we are trying
	to make set*id work on NT (if it even has set*id).
	* filesubr.c (isaccessable): new function.  Checks access-rights
	for files like access(), but is getxid-safe.  Falls back to
	access() if SETXID_SUPPORT is not enabled.
	(isfile): replace stat() by isaccessable(file, F_OK)
	(isreadable): replace access() by isaccessable()
	(iswritable): ditto
	(make_directory): rename local variable buf to sb

	file (fixes problem with deleting temporary files).

	spaces between arguments.

Thu Oct 26 10:12:51 1995  Jim Kingdon  <kingdon@harvey.cyclic.com>

Wed Oct 25 07:40:17 1995  Noel Cragg  <noel@virtual.office.com>

	* startserver.c (wnt_start_server): removed NTOHS call; since the
	resulting number was passed as the port number to rcmd which
	called NTOHS again, we did a complicated NOOP.

Tue Oct 24 10:59:03 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* Makefile.in: insert autoconf variables. This allows e.g. make
	  dist to work when configure was called from within a subdir.

	* Makefile.in (dist): replace by rule which honors $(srcdir)

Mon Oct 23 18:51:49 1995  Karl Fogel  <kfogel@floss.cyclic.com>

        * Makefile.in (clean): new rule, does nothing but satisfy
        top-level Makefile's beliefs about what its children can do.

Fri Oct 20 11:09:55 1995  Norbert Kiesel  <nk@col.sw-ley.de>

	* config.h: use same layout and comments as current ../config.h.in

	* ndir.c (opendir): Make the directory name argument a const
	char *, instead of just a char *.

Thu Aug 31 12:00:08 1995  Jim Blandy  <jimb@totoro.cyclic.com>

	(DISTFILES): Refer to them, and include README, Makefile.in, and
	.cvsignore.
