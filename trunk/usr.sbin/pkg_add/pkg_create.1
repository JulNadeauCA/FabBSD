.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command creates a binary package named
.Ar pkg-name ,
for subsequent use with
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_delete 1
and
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
.Ar pkg-name
will traditionally have a
.Dq .tgz
extension, to denote the underlying binary format.
.Ar pkg-name
must follow
.Xr packages-specs 7 .
.Pp
Use of the
.Xr ports 7
infrastructure instead of manual
.Nm
invocation is strongly recommended.
.Pp
During package creation,
.Nm
replaces too long file names with smaller equivalents
.Po
see
.Xr package 5
.Pc ,
records extra information in the packing-list, such as the existence
of symlinks and hard links, computes and stores file checksums, and
verifies that all special objects are properly annotated in the packing-list.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl A Ar arches
Register a list of architectures for which this package should install.
.Ar arches
is a comma-separated list of architectures.
Use
.Sq *
to mean any architecture (e.g., arch-independent packages).
.It Fl B Ar pkg-destdir
Set
.Ar pkg-destdir
as the prefix to prepend to any file to select for the package.
.It Fl c No [-] Ns Ar desc
Fetch package
.Dq one line description
from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Sq - ,
the argument itself.
This string should also
give some idea of which version of the product (if any) the package
represents.
Deprecated, use
.Fl D Ar COMMENT Ns = Ns Ar value
instead.
.It Fl D Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
Define
.Ar name
to
.Ar value ,
for substitution and fragment inclusion purposes.
.It Fl d No [-] Ns Ar desc
Fetch long description for package from file
.Ar desc
or, if preceded by
.Sq - ,
the argument itself.
.It Fl f Ar packinglist
Fetch
.Dq packing list
for package from the file
.Ar packinglist .
Several packing-lists can be mentioned, in which case they will be
concatenated together.
.It Fl i Ar iscript
Set
.Ar iscript
to be the install procedure for the package (deprecated, use
.Cm @exec
instead).
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later installed.
.It Fl k Ar dscript
Set
.Ar dscript
to be the de-install procedure for the package (deprecated, use
.Cm @unexec
instead).
This can be any executable program (or shell script).
It will be invoked automatically
when the package is later (if ever) de-installed.
.It Fl L Ar localbase
Record
.Ar localbase
as the localbase used in the package.
By default,
.Pa /usr/local .
Packages built with another localbase can only be installed by using
the same localbase in
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
to prevent errors.
.It Fl M Ar displayfile
Display the file (using
.Xr more 1 )
after installing the package.
Useful for things like
legal notices on almost-free software, etc.
.It Fl n
Don't actually create a package.
.It Fl P Ar pkg-dependency
Specify a
.Cm @depend
dependency on the command line.
.It Fl p Ar prefix
Set
.Ar prefix
as the initial directory
.Dq base
to start from in selecting files for
the package, and to record as the base for installing the package.
.It Fl Q
Print out the files in the actual packing-list of the package being
generated, with explicit typing
.Pq e.g. Cm @file , @lib , ... .
.It Fl q
Print out the actual packing-list of the package being generated
(query mode).
Most often used in combination with
.Fl n .
.It Fl S Ar pkg-destdir
Deprecated, use
identical
.Fl B
option instead.
.It Fl U Ar undisplayfile
Display the file (using
.Xr more 1 )
when deinstalling the package.
Useful for reminders about stuff to clean up.
.It Fl v
Turn on verbose output.
.It Fl W Ar wantedlib
Specify a
.Cm @wantlib
requirement on the command line.
.El
.Pp
.Nm
can also be invoked with only the packing-list from an installed package.
It will recreate the corresponding binary package in the current directory
from the installation, or error out if any problem is found.
For example,
the following will recreate a
.Pa kdelibs-3.4.3.tgz
package:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
pkg_create -f /var/db/pkg/kdelibs-3.4.3/+CONTENTS
.Ed
.Sh PACKING LIST DETAILS
The
.Dq packing list
format (see
.Fl f )
is fairly simple, being basically a list of filenames and directory names
to include in the package.
.Pp
Substitution of variables and inclusion of fragments is documented in the
next section.
.Pp
Directory names are denoted by a trailing slash.
.Pp
There are a few annotations that can be inserted for better control.
All these commands start with an
.Sq @ .
Here is a list:
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width Ds -compact
.Pp
.It Cm @arch Ar arches
List of architectures for which this package is intended.
.Pp
.It Cm @bin Ar filename
Describe the file as an
.Ox
binary executable (not a script).
.Pp
.It Cm @comment Ar string
Imbed a comment in the packing list.
Useful in trying to document some particularly hairy sequence that
may trip someone up later.
Can also be used to comment out elements that update-plist
.Pq see Xr bsd.port.mk 5
will insist in inserting in a packing-list.
.Pp
The special comment
.Cm @comment Ar "no checksum"
can be used to tag the next file as special: even though its characteristics
will be recorded in the package, it can be altered after installation, and
.Xr pkg_delete 1
will still delete it.
.Pp
.It Cm @conflict Ar pkgspec
Declare a conflict with packages matching
.Ar pkgspec
.Pq see Xr packages-specs 7 .
The
.Ar pkgname
package can
.Em not
be installed if a package
matching
.Ar pkgspec
has been installed because they install the same files and thus conflict.
.Pp
.It Cm @cwd Ar pathname
Set the package current directory.
All subsequent filenames will be assumed relative to
.Ar pathname .
.Pp
.It Xo
.Cm @depend
.Sm off
.Ar pkgpath :
.Ar pkgspec :
.Ar default
.Sm on
.Xc
Declare a dependency on a package matching
.Ar pkgspec
.Pq see Xr packages-specs 7 .
An appropriate package must be installed before this package may be
installed, and that package must be deinstalled before this package
is deinstalled.
The dependency also contains a
.Ar pkgpath
(see
.Ev FULLPKGPATH
in
.Xr bsd.port.mk 5 )
and a
.Ar default
package name, in case there is no listing of available packages.
.Pp
.It Cm @dir Ar directoryname
Create directory
.Pa directoryname
at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time, taking
.Cm @mode ,
.Cm @group ,
and
.Cm @owner
into account, and remove it during
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Directories to remove can be shared between packages.
If
.Ar name
does not begin with an @, same as
.Dl name/
.Pp
.It Cm @dirrm Ar directoryname
Declare directory
.Pa directoryname
to be deleted at deinstall time.
Deprecated, use
.Dl directoryname/
instead, as it handles proper directory creation as well.
.Pp
.It Cm @display Ar name
Declare
.Pa name
as the file to be displayed at install time (see
.Fl M
above).
.Pp
.It Cm @endfake
Mark end of packing-list for
.Xr pkg_add 1
.Fl Q
option.
.Pp
.It Cm @exec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
during
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
Note that
.Cm @exec
commands are executed relative to their location in the packing-list,
so they can rely on any data that have already been extracted,
but not on anything that is listed after them.
Some special elements, such as new users and new groups, are always
created first, so that
.Cm @exec
can rely on them.
If
.Ar command
contains any of the following sequences somewhere in it, they will
be expanded inline.
For the following examples, assume that
.Cm @cwd
is set to
.Pa /usr/local
and the last extracted file was
.Pa bin/emacs .
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Cm "\&%B"
Expands to the
.Dq basename
of the fully qualified filename, that
is the current directory prefix, plus the last filespec, minus
the trailing filename.
In the example case, that would be
.Pa /usr/local/bin .
.It Cm "\&%D"
Expands to the current directory prefix, as set with
.Cm @cwd ;
in the example case
.Pa /usr/local .
.It Cm "\&%F"
Expands to the last filename extracted (as specified); in the example case,
.Pa bin/emacs .
.It Cm "\&%f"
Expands to the
.Dq filename
part of the fully qualified name, or
the converse of
.Cm \&%B ;
in the example case,
.Pa emacs .
.El
.Pp
.It Cm @exec-always Ar command
Synonym of
.Cm @exec .
.Pp
.It Cm @exec-add Ar command
Similar to
.Cm @exec ,
except it only gets executed during new installations,
and not during updates.
.Pp
.It Cm @exec-update Ar command
Similar to
.Cm @exec ,
except it only gets executed during updates,
and not during new installations.
.Pp
.It Cm @extra Ar filename
Declare extra file
.Pa filename
to be deleted at deinstall time, if user sets the
.Fl c
option.
Those files are extra configuration files that are normally not deleted.
.Ar filename
can be an absolute path.
If
.Pa filename
ends with a slash, it is a directory.
.Pp
.It Cm @extraunexec Ar command
Extra
.Ar command
to execute when removing extra files.
.Pp
.It Cm @file Ar filename
Default annotation, to use if
.Ar filename
begins with @.
.Ar filename
is always a relative path, relative to the current
.Cm @cwd .
.Pp
.It Cm @fontdir Ar directoryname
Specialized version of
.Cm @dir ,
to handle font directories: create
.Pa font.alias
from
.Pa font.alias-*
fragments, execute
.Xr mkfontdir 1 ,
.Xr mkfontscale 1
and
.Xr fc-cache 1
when needed.
Delete extra files at
.Xr pkg_delete 1
time.
.Pp
.It Cm @group Ar group
Set default group ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar group .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
group ownership.
.Pp
.It Cm @ignore
Was used internally to tell extraction to ignore the next file.
No longer needed.
.Pp
.It Cm @info Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle GNU info files.
Automatically grab
.Pa filename-*
chapter files, run
.Xr install-info 1
as needed.
.Pp
.It Cm @lib Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle shared libraries.
Satisfy LIB_DEPENDS,
run
.Xr ldconfig 8
as needed.
.Pp
.It Cm @link Ar name
Added after a file entry by
.Nm
to record that the entry is actually a hard link.
.Pp
.It Cm @localbase Ar base
Used internally to record the settings of
.Fl L
option.
.Pp
.It Cm @man Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle manual pages.
.Pp
.It Cm @mandir Ar directoryname
Specialized version of
.Cm @dir ,
to handle manual directories: instruct user to add/remove the
directory to
.Xr man.conf 5 ,
remove
.Xr apropos 1
database when needed.
.Pp
.It Cm @md5
Added after a file entry by
.Nm
to record the files's cryptographic checksum.
.Pp
.It Cm @mode Ar mode
Set default permission for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar mode .
Format is the same as that used by the
.Xr chmod 1
command.
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction) permissions.
.Pp
.It Cm @name Ar pkgname
Set the name of the package.
This name is potentially different than the name of
the file it came in, and is used when keeping track of the package
for later deinstallation.
Note that
.Nm
will derive this field from the package name and add it automatically
if none is given.
.Pp
.It Cm @newgroup Ar name : Ns Ar gid
During
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
create a new group, using
.Xr groupadd 8 .
Happens before file and user creations.
.Ar gid
can be prefixed with a
.Sq !\&
to ensure group has the correct GID.
During
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
groups will be deleted if extra clean-up has been requested, and if
other installed packages don't list the same group.
.Pp
.It Xo
.Cm @newuser
.Sm off
.Ar name :
.Ar uid :
.Ar group :
.Ar loginclass :
.Ar comment :
.Ar home :
.Ar shell
.Sm on
.Xc
During
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
create a new user.
Happens before any file creation.
All fields correspond to
.Xr useradd 8
parameters.
Some fields are optional and can be left empty.
If the user already exists, no action is taken.
Individual fields can be prefixed by a
.Sq !\&
to make sure an existing
user matches.
For instance, the directive
.Li @newuser foo:!42
will make sure user foo has UID 42.
During
.Xr pkg_delete 1 ,
users will be deleted if extra clean-up has been requested, and if
other installed packages don't list the same user.
.Pp
.It Cm @option Ar name
Effects vary depending on
.Ar name .
Some options are not documented yet.
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Ar no-default-conflict
By default, a package conflicts with other versions of the same package.
With this option, the older package version will still be noticed, but the
installation will proceed anyway.
.El
.Pp
.It Cm @owner Ar user
Set default ownership for all subsequently extracted files to
.Ar user .
Use without an arg to set back to default (extraction)
ownership.
.Pp
.It Cm @pkgcfl Ar pkgcflname
Declare a conflict to the
.Ar pkgcflname
package.
The
.Ar pkgcflname
package must
.Em not
be installed if
.Ar pkgname
package gets installed because they install the same files and thus conflict.
.Ar pkgcflname
may use
.Xr fnmatch 3
wildcards.
Deprecated, use
.Cm @conflict
instead.
.Pp
.It Cm @pkgpath Ar pkgpath
Declare an extra
.Ar pkgpath
for the package.
This is used for updates:
.Nm pkg_add
.Fl u
normally checks that the
.Ar pkgpath
embedded in the package corresponds to the old package,
to solve ambiguities when packages with similar names are involved.
When ports get renamed, or flavors change, extra
.Cm @pkgpath
annotations can help
.Nm pkg_add
get a sense of continuity.
.Pp
.It Cm @sample Ar filename
Last preceding
.Cm @file
item is a sample configuration file, to be copied to
.Ar filename
at
.Xr pkg_add 1
time and to be removed at
.Xr pkg_delete 1
time.
During installation, existing configuration files are untouched.
During deinstallation, configuration files are only removed if unchanged.
.Ar filename
can be an absolute path.
If
.Ar filename
ends with a slash,
it refers to a configuration directory instead.
.Pp
.It Cm @shell Ar filename
Specialized version of
.Cm @file ,
to handle shells.
See
.Xr shells 5 .
.Pp
.It Cm @size
Added after a file entry by
.Nm
to record a file size.
.Pp
.It Cm @symlink Ar name
Added after a file entry by
.Nm
to record that the entry is actually a symbolic link.
.Pp
.It Cm @sysctl Ar var Ns = Ns Ar val
.It Cm @sysctl Ar var Ns \*(Ge Ns Ar val
During
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
check that
.Xr sysctl 8
variable
.Ar var
is set to exactly/at least a given value
.Ar val .
Adjust it otherwise.
.Pp
.It Cm @unexec Ar command
Execute
.Ar command
during
.Xr pkg_delete 1 .
Expansion of special
.Cm \&%
sequences is the same as for
.Cm @exec .
Note that
.Cm @unexec
commands are executed relative to their location in the packing-list,
so they cannot rely on any data that has already been deleted,
thus they should occur before the files they need to function.
Some special elements, such as new users and new groups, are always
deleted last, so that
.Cm @unexec
can rely on them.
.Pp
.It Cm @unexec-always Ar command
Synonym of
.Cm @unexec .
.Pp
.It Cm @unexec-delete Ar command
Similar to
.Cm @unexec ,
except it only gets executed during true deletions
and not while removing an old package during updates.
.Pp
.It Cm @unexec-update Ar command
Similar to
.Cm @unexec ,
except it only gets executed while removing an old package during updates,
and not during true deletions.
.Pp
.It Cm @wantlib Ar libspec
Package needs a shared library to work.
.Ar libspec
is
.Sq name.major.minor
or
.Sq path/name.major.minor .
The package won't be installed unless a library with the same name,
the exact same major number and at least the same minor number can
be located.
A library without path is searched through dependent packages under the
same
.Ar localbase ,
then in the system libraries under
.Pa /usr/lib
and
.Pa /usr/X11R6/lib .
A library with a path is only searched through dependent packages,
that path being relative to
.Ar localbase .
.El
.Sh VARIABLE SUBSTITUTION AND FRAGMENT INCLUSION
In packing-lists, installation, deinstallation and requirement scripts,
description and message files,
constructs like
.Li ${VAR}
will be replaced with the variable value, according to
.Fl D Ar name Ns = Ns Ar value
options.
.Pp
Constructs like
.Li %%VAR%%
and
.Li !%%VAR%%
trigger fragment inclusion.
If such a line is encountered in a packing-list, the corresponding variable
must be defined to 0 or 1.
If the variable's value is 1,
.Li %%VAR%%
will be replaced by the corresponding positive fragment, and
.Li !%%VAR%%
will be ignored.
If the variable's value is 0,
.Li %%VAR%%
will be ignored, and
.Li !%%VAR%%
will be replaced by the corresponding positive fragment.
.Pp
A fragment is an auxiliary packing-list file, whose name is derived from the
current packing-list, and the variable name
.Va VAR
triggering the inclusion:
.Pa pkg/PLIST
yields a positive fragment
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.VAR
and a negative fragment
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.no-VAR ,
.Pa pkg/PLIST-FOO
yields a positive fragment
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.VAR-foo
and a negative fragment
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.no-VAR-foo .
.Pp
Fragments can be included inside fragments, so that
.Li %%VAR2%%
inside
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.VAR
triggers the inclusion of
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.VAR2-VAR
and
.Li !%%VAR2%%
triggers the inclusion of
.Pa pkg/PFRAG.no-VAR2-VAR .
.Pp
If a positive or a negative fragment file does not exist, the corresponding
inclusion will be ignored.
However, if both the positive and negative fragment files do not exist,
.Nm
will error out, to make it easier to spot fragment names errors.
.Pp
As a special historical exception, the variable
.Va SHARED_LIBS
controls the inclusion of fragments
.Pa PFRAG.shared
and
.Pa PFRAG.no-shared
through the lines
.Li %%SHARED%%
and
.Li !%%SHARED%% .
