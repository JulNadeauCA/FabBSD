.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is used to create a file database for binary packages,
which can be searched using the
.Xr locate 1
utility.
.Pp
Entries created for each package will have the package name prepended:
.Li kdelibs-3.3.2p2:/usr/local/bin/meinproc .
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
option is used,
.Nm
will retrieve all package entries from the ports tree.
Otherwise,
.Nm
will build database entries for every file object for each
.Ar pkg-name
given on the command line,
or for every package in a
.Ar repository
specified as the
.Fl d
option.
If no package name is given,
.Nm
will build database entries for all currently installed packages.
.Pp
By default (unless standard output is a terminal),
the list of names is fed to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
and the end result should be redirected to a file.
.Pp
In addition,
.Nm
can also list files in the base sets of an
.Ox
distribution, which are not exactly packages in the usual sense.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl a
Prepend file names with pkgpath information and package names.
.It Fl d Ar repository
Scan directory
.Ar repository
for packages.
.It Fl n
Do not pipe output to
.Pa /usr/libexec/locate.mklocatedb
(default if standard output is a terminal).
.It Fl P
Prepend file names with pkgpath information instead of package name.
.It Fl p Ar portsdir
Retrieve packing lists from the ports tree instead of binary packages.
.It Fl q
Be quiet: do not report every package processed to standard error.
.It Fl r Ar release
Specify the location of a release directory
.Po
see
.Xr release 8
.Pc .
.Nm
will list release tar balls from that directory.
.It Fl s Ar src
Specify the location of
.Ox
source.
.Nm
will list sets found under that source directory.
.It Fl x Ar X11src
Specify the location of X11 source.
.Nm
will list sets found under that X11 source directory.
