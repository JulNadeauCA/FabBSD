.Dt PACKAGE 5
.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm package
.Nd format for
.Ox
binary packages
.Sh DESCRIPTION
Binary packages for
.Ox
can be created using
.Xr pkg_create 1
and
.Xr pkg_merge 1 ,
and are usually manipulated using
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_merge 1 ,
.Xr pkg_mklocatedb 1 ,
or
.Xr pkg_info 1 .
.Pp
The basic underlying format is an archive following the ustar specification
that can be handled with
.Xr tar 1
and compressed using
.Xr gzip 1 .
.Pp
Package names always end in
.Dq .tgz ;
the file name itself should conform to
.Xr packages-specs 7 .
.Pp
Note that the base distribution tarballs of
.Ox
(e.g.\&
.Pa baseXXX.tgz ,
.Pa compXXX.tgz ,
\&...) are not binary packages fit for
.Xr pkg_add 1 .
.Pp
All types of archive contents can be present in a package,
including files, directories, hardlinks, symlinks, fifos, block and character
devices.
.Pp
A special extension to the format, dubbed fat packages, is described in
the next section.
.Pp
In order to allow just-in-time extraction,
packages always begin with a table of contents, named
.Pa +CONTENTS .
This table of contents can be read using the API described in
.Xr OpenBSD::PackingList 3p .
.Pp
All the remaining information in the archive should be referenced in
the packing-list, including all relevant information: symlinks destinations,
special permissions, and file owners.
See
.Xr pkg_create 1
for annotation details.
.Pp
This table of contents is always followed by a few special files, some of
which are optional: the package description (+DESC), an installation script
(+INSTALL), a display message (+MESSAGE), etc.
.Pp
The ustar format has some limitations with respect to file names.
Accordingly, the package tools will replace very long names with
.Pa LongName#n
and long link names with
.Pa LongLink#n .
The packing-list will hold the real file names, and the package tools
will reconstitute the correct names behind the scenes.
.Sh FAT PACKAGES DESCRIPTION
The
.Xr pkg_merge 1
command can create fat packages, which coalesce several normal packages in
a single ustar archive, by interleaving their contents.
.Pp
Other tools, such as
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
are aware of fat packages and can handle them transparently.
.Pp
In a fat package, every item has a small prefix that identifies the
original package.
For instance, after merging two packages, the package will usually
begin with
.Pa a/+CONTENTS
and
.Pa b/+CONTENTS .
Individual items will then begin with
.Pa ab/file ,
for a file common to both packages;
.Pa a/file
for a file belonging to the first package;
and
.Pa b/file
for a file belonging to the second package.
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr pkg_add 1 ,
.Xr pkg_create 1 ,
.Xr pkg_info 1 ,
.Xr pkg_merge 1 ,
.Xr packages 7 ,
.Xr packages-specs 7
.Sh STANDARDS
Packages are valid gzip'ed ustar archives that can be extracted using
.Xr tar 1 .
In particular, hardlink names should be valid, and all items will
extract to different names.
However, it may be a bit difficult to make sense of the package contents
without peeking at the packing-list.
