.Sh NAME
.Nm config
.Nd build kernel compilation directories or modify a kernel
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm config
.Op Fl p
.Op Fl b Ar builddir
.Op Fl s Ar srcdir
.Op Ar config-file
.Nm config
.Op Fl u
.Op Fl f | o Ar outfile
.Fl e
.Ar infile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
In the first synopsis form, the
.Nm
program creates a kernel build directory from the kernel configuration file
specified by
.Ar config-file .
.Pp
In the second synopsis form,
.Nm
allows editing of the kernel binary specified by
.Ar infile .
Devices may be enabled, disabled, or modified without recompiling,
by editing the kernel executable.
Similarly, the same editing can be done at boot-time,
using the in-kernel editor,
as described in
.Xr boot_config 8 .
.Pp
For kernel building, the options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl b Ar builddir
Create the build directory in the path specified by
.Ar builddir
instead of the default
.Pa ../compile/SYSTEMNAME .
.It Fl p
Configure for a system that includes profiling code; see
.Xr kgmon 8
and
.Xr gprof 1 .
When this option is specified,
.Nm
acts as if the lines
.Dq makeoptions PROF="-pg"
and
.Dq option GPROF
appeared in the specified kernel configuration file.
In addition,
.Dq .PROF
is appended to the default compilation directory name.
.Pp
The
.Fl p
flag is expected to be used for
.Dq one-shot
profiles of existing systems; for regular profiling, it is probably wiser to
make a separate configuration containing the makeoptions line.
.It Fl s Ar srcdir
Use
.Ar srcdir
as the top-level kernel source directory instead of the default (four
directories above the build directory).
.El
.Pp
For kernel modification, the options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl e
Allows the modification of kernel device configuration (see
.Xr boot_config 8 ) .
Temporary changes can be made to the running kernel's configuration or a new
kernel binary may be written for permanent changes between system reboots.
See the section
.Sx KERNEL MODIFICATION
below for more details.
.It Fl f
Overwrite the
.Ar infile
kernel binary with the modified kernel.
Otherwise,
.Fl o
should be given to specify an alternate output file.
.It Fl o Ar outfile
Write the modified kernel to
.Ar outfile .
.It Fl u
Check to see if the kernel configuration was modified at boot-time
(i.e.\&
.Cm boot -c
was used).
If so, compare the running kernel with the kernel to be edited
.Pq Ar infile .
If they seem to be the same, apply all configuration changes performed at
boot.
.El
.Sh KERNEL BUILDING
The old
.Fl g
flag is deprecated and no longer supported.
Instead, add
.Dq makeoptions DEBUG="-g"
to the kernel configuration file, along with (typically)
.Dq option KGDB .
.Pp
The output of
.Nm
consists of a number of files, principally
.Pa ioconf.c
(a description of I/O devices that may be attached to the system)
and a
.Pa Makefile ,
used by
.Xr make 1
when building the kernel.
.Pp
After running
.Nm
it is wise to run
.Dq make depend
in the new build directory.
.Nm
prints a reminder of this when it completes.
.Pp
If
.Nm
stops due to errors, the problems reported should be corrected and
.Nm
should be run again.
.Nm
attempts to avoid changing the compilation directory if there are
configuration errors, but this code is not well-tested and some problems
(such as running out of disk space) are unrecoverable.
.Pp
If
.Ar config-file
is not specified,
.Nm
uses the current directory as the build directory, and looks in it for
a file called
.Pa CONFIG .
If
.Nm
is run this way, the location of the top-level kernel source
directory must be specified using the
.Fl s
option or by using the
.Dq Li source
directive at the beginning of the system configuration file.
.Pp
The configuration files consists of various statements which
include the following:
.Bl -tag -offset indent -width indent
.It machine Ar var
Required.
Specifies the machine architecture.
.It include Ar file
Include another configuration file.
.It option Ar name
Set a kernel option.
Kernel options may take either the form
.Ar NAME
or the form
.Ar NAME=value .
These options are passed to the compiler with the
.Fl D
flag.
.It rmoption Ar name
Delete a previously set option.
This is useful when including another kernel configuration file.
A typical use is to include the
.Va GENERIC
kernel provided with each release and remove options that are
unwanted, thus allowing for automatic inclusion of new device
drivers.
.It maxusers Ar number
Required.
Used to size various system tables and maximum operating conditions
in an approximate fashion.
Multiple instances of this keyword may be specified.
The number provided in the last instance will be used, and
warnings will be printed for each duplicate value.
This is convenient when used with the
.Va include
directive.
.It config Ar bsd root on "dev [swap on dev [and dev ...]] [dumps on dev [and dev ...]]"
Required.
Specifies the swap and dump devices which the system should use.
.It config Ar bsd swap generic
Otherwise, if generic is specified, the system follows generic routines to
decide what should happen.
.El
.Pp
Many other statements exist, and the file format is fairly rich; for more
information see the various configuration files included in the system, as
well as
.Xr files.conf 5
for the
.Nm
rules base.
.Sh KERNEL MODIFICATION
When
.Fl e
is specified, device parameters that are normally hard-coded into the kernel
may be changed.
This is useful to avoid the need for kernel recompilation or rebooting.
Modifications are made to the currently running kernel and can be written to
a new kernel binary so changes are preserved during subsequent system restarts.
.Pp
When invoked, the kernel identification is first shown.

.Sh EXAMPLES (kernel building)
Note:
The standard
.Ox
kernel configuration
(GENERIC or GENERIC.MP)
is suitable for most purposes.
Use of an alternative kernel configuration is not recommended.
A custom kernel is built in the following way.
.Pp
To compile a kernel from a non-writable media (such as a CD-ROM)
mounted on
.Pa /usr/src ,
do the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cd /somedir
# cp /usr/src/sys/arch/somearch/conf/SOMEFILE .
# vi SOMEFILE	(to make any changes)
# config -s /usr/src/sys -b . SOMEFILE
# make
.Ed
.Pp
To compile a kernel inside a writable source tree, do the following:
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# cd /usr/src/sys/arch/somearch/conf
# vi SOMEFILE	(to make any changes)
# config SOMEFILE
# cd ../compile/SOMEFILE
# make
.Ed
.Pp
In the examples above,
.Ar somedir
is a writable directory,
.Ar somearch
is the architecture (e.g. i386),
and
.Ar SOMEFILE
should be a name indicative of a particular configuration (often
that of the hostname).
.Nm config
will warn if a
.Dq make clean
is required;
a
.Dq make depend
can also be run
to have dependencies there the next time sources are compiled.
.Pp
The new kernel, called
.Pa bsd ,
can be copied to
.Pa /bsd
and the system will boot it next time.
Most people save their backup kernels as
.Pa /bsd.1 ,
.Pa /bsd.2 ,
etc.
.Sh EXAMPLES (kernel modification)
The Ethernet card is not detected at boot because the kernel configuration
does not match the physical hardware configuration,
e.g. wrong IRQ in FabBSD/i386.
The Ethernet card is supposed to use the
.Xr ne 4
driver.
.Bd -literal

ukc\*(Gt
.Ed

ne1 seems to match the configuration except it uses IRQ 5 instead of IRQ 10.
So the irq on ne1 should be changed via the
.Ic change
command.
The device can be specified by either name or number.
.Bd -literal

ukc\*(Gt
.Ed
.Pp
Another case is a mistakenly detected non-existing device instead of another
device at the probed location.
One known case is the Mitsumi
CD-ROM in FabBSD/i386.
The simplest thing to solve that problem is to disable mcd0.
.Bd -literal
.No ukc\*(Gt Ic find mcd0
 29 mcd0 at isa0 port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 10 drq -1 drq2 -1 flags 0x0

.No ukc\*(Gt Ic find 29
 29 mcd0 at isa0 disable port 0x300 size 0 iomem -1 iosiz 0 irq 10 drq -1 drq2 -1 flags 0x0
.Ed
.Pp
It's also possible to disable all devices with a common attribute.
For example:
.Bd -literal
.No ukc\*(Gt Ic disable port 0x300
 25 ne1 disabled
 29 mcd0 already disabled
 72 we1 disabled
 75 el0 disabled
 77 ie1 disabled

.Pp
The
.Cm show
command is useful for finding which devices have a certain attribute.
It can also be used to find those devices with a particular value for
an attribute.
