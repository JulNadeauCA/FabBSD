.Sh NAME
.Nm cncctl
.Nd configure the motion control (cnc) device
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm cncctl
.Op Fl Cc
.Op Fl s Ar modifier
.Op Fl F Ar modifier
.Op Fl p Ar coords
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility configures the motion control system via the
.Xr cnc 4
interface.
The commands are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Calibrate the timings necessary for the trajectory planner's spin delay loops.
The operation can take several minutes and the FabBSD kernel will not respond
to interrupts during the calibration.
This only needs to be done once for any given machine.
The results will be saved to
.Pa /var/db/cnc.timings .
.It Fl c
Reread the timing calibration data from
.Pa /var/db/cnc.timings .
This command is typically invoked by the
.Pa /etc/rc
boot script.
.It Fl s Ar modifier
Show the cnc parameters specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl s Cm devices
List the devices registered with the motion control system.
.It Fl s Cm info
Display various statistics and counters.
.It Fl s Cm limits
Display the kinematic limits in effect.
.It Fl s Cm position
Print the current machine position (in steps).
.El
.It Fl F Ar modifier
Flush the cnc parameters specified by
.Ar modifier
(may be abbreviated):
.Pp
.Bl -tag -width xxxxxxxxxxx -compact
.It Fl s Cm info
Flush all statistics and counters.
.El
.It Fl p Ar coords
Set the current machine position.
This changes the kernel's idea of the actual machine position, no motion is
performed.
The boot scripts use this command to save and restore the coordinates across
system reboots.
.El
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width "/var/db/cnc.timings" -compact
.It Pa /etc/cncctl.conf
Packet filter rules file.
.It Pa /var/db/cnc.timings
Timing calibration data.

.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
program first appeared in FabBSD 1.0.
