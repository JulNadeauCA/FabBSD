.Sh NAME
.Nm slattach
.Nd attach serial lines as network interfaces
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm slattach
.Op Fl hm
.Op Fl s Ar baudrate
.Ar ttyname
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
command is deprecated.
Please use the
.Xr ldattach 8
command instead.
.Pp
.Nm
is used to assign a tty line to a network interface,
and will attach the named tty line to the first
available slipdevice that is configured and up.
.Pp
The following operands are supported by
.Nm slattach :
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Fl h
Turn on RTS/CTS flow control.
By default, no flow control is done.
.It Fl m
Maintain modem control signals after closing the line.
Specifically, this disables HUPCL.
.It Fl s Ar baudrate
Specifies the speed of the connection.
If not specified, the default of 9600 is used.
.It Ar ttyname
Specifies the name of the tty device.
.Ar ttyname
should be a string of the form
.Dq ttyXX ,
or
.Dq /dev/ttyXX .
.El
.Pp
In addition, the following flags to
.Xr ifconfig 8
control various properties of the link:
.Bl -tag -width Ar
.It Ar link0
Turn on Van Jacobsen header compression.
.It Ar -link0
Turn off header compression.
.It Ar link1
Don't pass through ICMP packets.
.It Ar -link1
Do pass through ICMP packets.
.It Ar link2
If a packet with a compressed header is received, automatically enable
compression of outgoing packets.
.It Ar -link2
Don't auto-enable compression.
.El
.Pp
Only the superuser may attach a network interface.
.Pp
To detach the interface, use
.Dq Li ifconfig interface-name down
after killing off the
.Nm
process.
.Ar interface-name
is the name that is shown by
.Xr netstat 1 .
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bd -literal -offset indent
# ifconfig sl0 10.0.0.1 10.0.0.2 link0 link2 up
# slattach ttyh8
# ifconfig sl1 192.168.0.1 192.168.0.2 link0 up
# slattach \-s 4800 /dev/tty01
.Ed
.Sh DIAGNOSTICS
Messages indicating the specified interface does not exist, the
requested address is unknown, the user is not privileged and
tried to alter an interface's configuration.
