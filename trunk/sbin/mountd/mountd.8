.Sh NAME
.Nm mountd
.Nd service remote
.Tn NFS
mount requests
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm mountd
.Op Fl dn
.Op Ar exportsfile
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is the server for
.Tn NFS
mount requests from other client machines.
.Nm
listens for service requests at the port indicated in the
.Tn NFS
server specification; see
.%T "Network File System Protocol Specification" ,
RFC 1094, Appendix A and
.%T "NFS: Network File System Version 3 Protocol Specification" ,
Appendix I.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl d
Enable debugging mode.
.Nm
will not detach from the controlling terminal and will print
debugging messages to stderr.
.It Fl n
Do not require that clients make mount requests from reserved ports.
(Normally, only mount requests from reserved ports are accepted.)
This option should only be specified if there are clients, such as PCs,
that need it.
The use of
.Fl n
is STRONGLY discouraged, as it opens up a wide range of security problems.
.It Ar exportsfile
The
.Ar exportsfile
argument specifies an alternate location
for the exports file.
.El
.Pp
When
.Nm
is started,
it loads the export host addresses and options into the kernel
using the
.Xr mount 2
system call.
After changing the exports file,
a hangup signal should be sent to the
.Nm
daemon
to get it to reload the export information.
After sending the
.Dv SIGHUP
(kill \-HUP `cat /var/run/mountd.pid`),
check the syslog output to see if
.Nm
logged any parsing
errors in the exports file.
.Sh FILES
.Bl -tag -width /var/run/mountd.pid -compact
.It Pa /etc/exports
list of exported filesystems
.It Pa /var/run/mountd.pid
PID of the currently running
.Nm
.El
.Sh SEE ALSO
.Xr nfsstat 1 ,
.Xr exports 5 ,
.Xr nfsd 8 ,
.Xr portmap 8 ,
.Xr showmount 8
.Sh HISTORY
The
.Nm
utility first appeared in
.Bx 4.4 .
