.Os
.Sh NAME
.Nm fsck_msdos
.Nd DOS/Windows (FAT) file system consistency checker
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm fsck_msdos
.Op Fl fnpy
.Ar filesystem ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
utility verifies and repairs
.Tn FAT
file systems (more commonly known as
.Tn DOS
file systems).
It checks the specified file systems and tries to repair all
detected inconsistencies, requesting confirmation before
making any changes.
.Pp
If the
.Fl p
flag is given,
.Nm
preens the specified file systems.
It is normally started this way by
.Xr fsck 8
run from
.Xr rc 8
during automatic reboot, when a FAT file system is detected.
When preening file systems,
.Nm
will fix common inconsistencies non-interactively.
If more serious problems are found,
.Nm
does not try to fix them, indicates that it was not
successful, and exits.
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl f
This option is ignored by
.Nm fsck_msdos ,
and is present only for compatibility with programs that
check other file system types for consistency, such as
.Xr fsck_ffs 8 .
.It Fl n
Assume a
.Dq no
response to all questions asked by
.Nm
except for
.Dq CONTINUE? ,
which is assumed to be affirmative.
File systems will not be opened for writing.
This is the default for file systems to be checked that are
concurrently mounted writable.
.It Fl p
Preen the specified file systems.
.It Fl y
Causes
.Nm
to assume
.Dq yes
as the answer to all operator questions.
