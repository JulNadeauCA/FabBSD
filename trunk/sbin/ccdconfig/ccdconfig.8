.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is used to dynamically configure and unconfigure concatenated disk
devices, or ccds.
For more information about the ccd, see
.Xr ccd 4 .
.Pp
The options are as follows:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Fl C
Configure all ccd devices listed in the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl c
Configure a ccd.
This is the default behavior of
.Nm ccdconfig .
.It Fl f Ar config_file
When configuring or unconfiguring all devices, read the file
.Pa config_file
instead of the default
.Pa /etc/ccd.conf .
.It Fl U
Unconfigure all ccd devices listed in the ccd configuration file.
.It Fl u
Unconfigure a ccd.
.It Fl v
Causes
.Nm
to be verbose.
.El
.Pp
A ccd is described on the command line and in the ccd configuration
file by the name of the ccd, the interleave factor, the ccd configuration
flags, and a list of one or more devices.
The flags may be represented
as a decimal number, a hexadecimal number, a comma-separated list
of strings, or the word
.Dq none .
The flags are as follows:
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
CCDF_SWAP		0x01		Interleave should be dmmax.
CCDF_UNIFORM	0x02		Use uniform interleave.
CCDF_MIRROR	0x04		Enable data mirroring.
.Ed
.Pp
The format in the
configuration file appears exactly as if it were entered on the command line.
Note that on the command line and in the configuration file, the
.Ar flags
argument is optional.

.Sh EXAMPLES
The following command, executed from the command line, would configure ccd0
with 4 components (/dev/sd2e, /dev/sd3e, /dev/sd4e, /dev/sd5e), and an
interleave factor of 32 blocks.
.Bd -unfilled -offset indent
# ccdconfig ccd0 32 0 /dev/sd2e /dev/sd3e /dev/sd4e /dev/sd5e
